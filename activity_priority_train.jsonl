Generate only one Action command.\n- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.\n- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.\n- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.\n\nHere is a description of how to use this command:\n## Action\n- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.\n- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.\n- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.\n- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query <\/execute> or <respond> user response <\/respond>\n\n# Guidelines\n- Execute SOQL\/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.\n- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.\n- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.\n- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.\n\n# Example 1\nQuestion: What is the total number of opportunities?\nOutput:\n<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity <\/execute>\n     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)\n<respond> 100 <\/respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 <\/respond>\n\n# Example 2\nQuestion: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.\nOutput:\n<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) <\/execute>\n    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)\n<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 <\/respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 <\/respond>\n\n# Salesforce instance description\nThe objects available in the Salesforce instance are:\nUser, Account, Contact, Case, Knowledge__kav, ProductCategory, Product2, ProductCategoryProduct, Pricebook2, PricebookEntry, Order, OrderItem, EmailMessage, LiveChatTranscript, Issue__c, CaseHistory__c, Opportunity, OpportunityLineItem, Quote, QuoteLineItem, Contract, VoiceCallTranscript__c, Task, Event, Territory2, UserTerritory2Association, Lead\n\n## The fields available for the objects along with their descriptions and dependencies are:\nUser\n  - Alias: Alias, usually a shortened version of the agent's name\n  - Email: Email address of the agent\n  - EmailEncodingKey: Email encoding, usually 'UTF-8'\n  - FirstName: First name of the agent\n  - Id: ID of the user\n  - LanguageLocaleKey: Language locale, e.g., 'en_US'\n  - LastName: Last name of the agent\n  - LocaleSidKey: Locale, e.g., 'en_US'\n  - Phone: Phone number of the agent\n  - ProfileId: ID of the user profile, typically 'Standard User' or a similar profile\n  - TimeZoneSidKey: Time zone, e.g., 'America\/Los_Angeles'\n  - Username: Unique username for the agent in Salesforce\nAccount\n  - Description: Detailed description of the account\n  - Id: ID of the account\n  - Industry: Industry the account belongs to\n  - Name: Name of the account\n  - NumberOfEmployees: Number of employees in the account\n  - Phone: Phone number of the account\n  - ShippingState: State for shipping address\nContact\n  - AccountId: References Account object\n  - Email: Email address of the contact\n  - FirstName: First name of the contact\n  - Id: ID of the contact\n  - LastName: Last name of the contact\nCase\n  - AccountId: References Account object\n  - ClosedDate: Date when the case was closed in 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' format\n  - ContactId: ID of the contact associated with this case.
