# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I'm glad we could connect. I was looking over the details you provided about your interest in the PulseSim Pro. Is now a good time to discuss?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:30] Ali Hussein: Yes, now works for me. I'm interested to learn more and see how it fits with what we need.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:40] Ava Sullivan: Fantastic! From what you’ve mentioned, you’re interested in four units of the PulseSim Pro, correct?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:50] Ali Hussein: That's right. We want to enhance our simulation capabilities, and the PulseSim Pro seems like a great fit.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:05] Ava Sullivan: Absolutely. The PulseSim Pro is one of our top products for high precision simulation. It offers advanced analytics and seamless integration with existing systems, which is great for boosting efficiency.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:15] Ali Hussein: Those features sound beneficial. We do have a tight timeline for installation, though. Could you tell me more about that?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:30] Ava Sullivan: Certainly. We understand the importance of meeting tight schedules. We usually aim to complete installations within a day and ensure everything runs smoothly. Our technical team is very efficient.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:40] Ali Hussein: That’s reassuring. And as for the budget, how does it look for four units?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:55] Ava Sullivan: Considering your budget is $2,261, I think we can work something out. Each PulseSim Pro unit is priced at $500. For four units, it will come to $2,000. This is below your budget, leaving room for additional services if you wish.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:10] Ali Hussein: That fits really well. I'd like to move forward, but I'll need to consult with the finance team here since I don’t have the final say.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:20] Ava Sullivan: I completely understand, Ali. Would you like me to send over a detailed proposal and pricing information so you can present it to your team?\n[2023-10-21T10:04:25] Ali Hussein: Yes, please. That would be very helpful.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:35] Ava Sullivan: Great! I'll have that to you by the end of the day.

I was looking at how it might fit our needs here.\n[2023-10-10T09:00:30] Carmen Silva: Great! Could you tell me a bit more about what you're hoping to accomplish with UnitySim Essentials?\n[2023-10-10T09:00:42] Liam Wong: Sure, we're looking to enhance our simulation capabilities for training purposes, and it seems like UnitySim could be a good fit.\n[2023-10-10T09:00:55] Carmen Silva: Absolutely, UnitySim Essentials is designed exactly for that. It provides comprehensive simulation tools that are very user-friendly. May I ask, what's your budget for this project?\n[2023-10-10T09:01:06] Liam Wong: Our budget is around $586. We're pretty tight, so staying within that is important.\n[2023-10-10T09:01:16] Carmen Silva: I totally understand. Our pricing for UnitySim Essentials is $500 for a single license, which keeps you within budget and leaves a little room in case of any additional needs.\n[2023-10-10T09:01:28] Liam Wong: That sounds promising.

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

Am I speaking with Raj Patel?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:07] Raj Patel: Yes, this is Raj speaking. How can I help you today?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:18] Dariusz Wisniewski: Great, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today, Raj. I wanted to discuss your interest in our solutions, specifically the OptiEnergy Suite, CollabCircuit Hub, and CollabDesign Studio. Is this a good time to chat?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:24] Raj Patel: Absolutely, I've been looking forward to learning more about your products.\n[2023-10-20T10:00:31] Dariusz Wisniewski: Fantastic! Let’s start with the OptiEnergy Suite. You mentioned an interest in acquiring four units, is that correct?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:38] Raj Patel: Yes, that’s right. We're specifically looking to optimize our energy consumption.\n[2023-10-20T10:00:52] Dariusz Wisniewski: The OptiEnergy Suite is perfect for that. It’s designed to streamline your energy use, reducing costs by up to 30%. It includes AI-driven analytics for real-time insights. Would that align with your goals?\n[2023-10-20T10:01:05] Raj Patel: Sounds promising. I’d like to know more about the installation timeline, as we're on a tight schedule and aim to complete it within three days.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:22] Dariusz Wisniewski: Understood. We're committed to meeting tight deadlines, and our professional team can certainly manage the setup within your desired timeframe. We’ll handle everything from inspection to implementation while ensuring minimal disruption to your operations.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:34] Raj Patel: That's reassuring. How about the pricing? You mentioned reducing costs; what's the upfront cost looking like?\n[2023-10-20T10:01:52] Dariusz Wisniewski: Great question, Raj. The pricing for the OptiEnergy Suite is highly competitive, especially when you consider the long-term savings. However, with your current budget of $3,203, we can explore potential discounts or financing options to accommodate this.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:06] Raj Patel: That would be very helpful since I don't have full financial authority to approve large expenses. Are there other benefits I should be aware of?\n[2023-10-20T10:02:22] Dariusz Wisniewski: Of course. Besides cost savings, the OptiEnergy Suite enhances operational efficiency and improves sustainability, which is crucial in today's business environment. Let me also touch on the CollabCircuit Hub, which you’ve shown interest in.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:31] Raj Patel: Sure, I'm interested in how the CollabCircuit Hub can facilitate better collaboration.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:49] Dariusz Wisniewski: The CollabCircuit Hub enables seamless communication across teams, essential for businesses prioritizing effective teamwork. It integrates easily with systems you likely already use, and can substantially increase productivity. Interested in knowing more about how it can transform your operations?\n[2023-10-20T10:02:57] Raj Patel: Definitely. We’re always looking to improve team collaboration.\n[2023-10-20T10:03:10] Dariusz Wisniewski: Perfect. And for the CollabDesign Studio, which you’re considering one unit of—it's ideal for high-quality design projects that require precision and creativity.\n[2023-10-20T10:03:17] Raj Patel: Just one unit for now. We want to test its effectiveness before expanding.\n[2023-10-20T10:03:30] Dariusz Wisniewski: That makes sense. It’s a powerhouse for design tasks, and we’re confident you’ll find it quite transformative. Would you like to discuss how we can move forward and address any more concerns?\n[2023-10-20T10:03:39] Raj Patel: Not right now. I’ll need to discuss internally before making any decisions.\n[2023-10-20T10:03:53] Dariusz Wisniewski: Absolutely. I'll send over detailed proposals for each product, including pricing and implementation specifics, which you can then review with your team. If any questions arise, feel free to reach out.\n[2023-10-20T10:04:00] Raj Patel: That sounds great. Thank you for your help, Dariusz.\n[2023-10-20T10:04:07] Dariusz Wisniewski: My pleasure, Raj.

5,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

6,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

May I speak with Carlos Martinez, please?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:05] Carlos Martinez: Hi Yuki, this is Carlos speaking. How can I help you today?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:12] Yuki Kato: Hi Carlos! Thanks for taking the time to speak with me. I understand you're interested in our SimulateX Edge and UnitySim Essentials products. Is that correct?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:20] Carlos Martinez: Yes, that's right. I'm considering purchasing two SimulateX Edge units and one UnitySim Essentials.\n[2023-10-21T10:00:30] Yuki Kato: Great! Before we dive into details, do you have a specific need or project you're planning that these products would be used for?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:40] Carlos Martinez: Well, to be honest, I don’t have a very clear need yet. I'm just exploring possibilities for some future expansions in our operations.\n[2023-10-21T10:00:50] Yuki Kato: I see! It's always good to stay ahead of the curve. Just to clarify, how soon are you looking to have everything set up and running?\n[2023-10-21T10:01:00] Carlos Martinez: Ideally, we want to finish the installation within a day after purchase. Our schedule is quite packed, and we want minimal disruption.\n[2023-10-21T10:01:10] Yuki Kato: That's absolutely understandable. Our team is quite efficient with installations, but just to confirm, would that timeline align with your current operations?\n[2023-10-21T10:01:18] Carlos Martinez: Yes, it should be fine. I have the authority to make financial decisions so as long as it fits our budget, we can proceed quickly.\n[2023-10-21T10:01:30] Yuki Kato: Perfect. Speaking of budget, our SimulateX Edge is priced competitively at $800 per unit and the UnitySim Essentials comes at $450. That would bring your total to $2,050 before any applicable discounts.\n[2023-10-21T10:01:45] Carlos Martinez: I see. The price is a bit over my initial budget of $1,688. Are there any discounts or options available to accommodate this?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:00] Yuki Kato: Let me see what we can do. Since you're interested in multiple units and have the potential for future purchases, I can offer a bundled discount, bringing the total closer to your budget at approximately $1,700. How does that sound?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:15] Carlos Martinez: That sounds much better. Could you also tell me a bit about how these products might benefit our operations? As I mentioned, I’m just exploring options, so any insights would be helpful.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:30] Yuki Kato: Absolutely, Carlos. The SimulateX Edge is designed to streamline and optimize your workflows with advanced simulation capabilities, while the UnitySim Essentials package ensures you have the foundational tools needed for seamless integration. These together enhance productivity and accuracy, which could be a great asset for any expansion you’re considering.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:45] Carlos Martinez: I appreciate that explanation, Yuki. It does sound like it could be beneficial down the road.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:55] Yuki Kato: Glad to hear it, Carlos. Would you like me to draft up the details in a formal proposal and send it over? That way you can review everything at your leisure before making a decision.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:02] Carlos Martinez: Yes, that would be great. I look forward to seeing it.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:10] Yuki Kato: Wonderful. I'll have that sent over by the end of the day. If you have any other questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out. Thank you for your time today, Carlos.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:20] Carlos Martinez: Thanks, Yuki. I appreciate the detailed information. Talk to you soon!\n[2023-10-21T10:03:25] Yuki Kato: My pleasure.

8,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

It comes with seamless integration capabilities. It’s also backed by our comprehensive support team.\n[2023-10-23T10:01:25] Priya Rao: That sounds really good. How about the pricing? Does it fit within our budget?\n[2023-10-23T10:01:33] Pedro Alvarez: For two units, you’re looking at the standard price of $530 each. This perfectly aligns with your $1063 budget, with some room to spare.\n[2023-10-23T10:01:42] Priya Rao: That's good to know. What if we need additional support post-installation?\n[2023-10-23T10:01:50] Pedro Alvarez: We offer different support packages ranging from basic to premium, depending on your needs. The basic package is complimentary for the first year.\n[2023-10-23T10:01:59] Priya Rao: Interesting. I’ll probably want to start with the basic support and decide later based on our needs.\n[2023-10-23T10:02:05] Pedro Alvarez: That makes sense. We'll tailor the package based on how your operations evolve.\n[2023-10-23T10:02:11] Priya Rao: Sounds like a plan. What's the next step if we decide to go forward?\n[2023-10-23T10:02:20] Pedro Alvarez: The next step would be for me to send over a proposal outlining the details we discussed. Once you approve, we can schedule the installation at your earliest convenience, prioritizing within a day as you requested.\n[2023-10-23T10:02:28] Priya Rao: Perfect. Could you send that over today?\n[2023-10-23T10:02:33] Pedro Alvarez: Absolutely, Priya. I’ll have it in your inbox by this afternoon.\n[2023-10-23T10:02:38] Priya Rao: Great. Thanks for your help, Pedro. Looking forward to it.\n[2023-10-23T10:02:43] Pedro Alvarez: Thank you, Priya. It’s been a pleasure talking with you. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out anytime.\n[2023-10-23T10:02:47] Priya Rao: Will do. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-23T10:02:50] Pedro Alvarez: You too!

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

I hope you're having a good day too. I wanted to discuss your potential interest in VerifySim Elite. Do you mind if we dive into that?\n[2023-10-11T10:00:24] Ahmed Hariri: Sure, let's get into it.\n[2023-10-11T10:00:29] Luciana Alves: Great! So, you're looking at the VerifySim Elite for your business. You're interested in acquiring four units, right?\n[2023-10-11T10:00:35] Ahmed Hariri: That's correct.\n[2023-10-11T10:00:41] Luciana Alves: Perfect. Before we proceed, can I ask what initially caught your attention about the VerifySim Elite?\n[2023-10-11T10:00:50] Ahmed Hariri: Well, I've heard good things about its efficiency, but to be honest, I haven't nailed down a specific need yet.\n[2023-10-11T10:01:05] Luciana Alves: That's completely okay. The VerifySim Elite is known for its reliability and ability to streamline operations with its advanced simulation capabilities, which can offer significant efficiency gains. How critical is improved efficiency to your current operations?\n[2023-10-11T10:01:21] Ahmed Hariri: I believe any improvement in efficiency is beneficial, but the immediate motivation isn't clear at this point.\n[2023-10-11T10:01:37] Luciana Alves: Understood. Just so you know, many of our clients who initially didn't have a clear need found the product increased their flexibility in project handling. I see that you have a budget of 2919 for this. Does that fall in line with what you expected for these units?\n[2023-10-11T10:01:49] Ahmed Hariri: Yes, that's within what I was thinking. However, I'm firm about sticking to that budget.\n[2023-10-11T10:02:07] Luciana Alves: That's definitely workable. Given your budget and the requested installation timeline of finishing it within 1 day, our team can prioritize your order to ensure quick installation and setup. We often see installations completed in less than 24 hours.\n[2023-10-11T10:02:16] Ahmed Hariri: Oh, that's good to know. Quick turnaround is certainly appreciated.\n[2023-10-11T10:02:30] Luciana Alves: Absolutely. I’d like to make sure this fits into your operational flow seamlessly. If needed, our team can provide ongoing support to ensure everything is running optimally. Would that be beneficial to you?\n[2023-10-11T10:02:42] Ahmed Hariri: That might be helpful, yes. It's important to ensure smooth operations from the get-go.\n[2023-10-11T10:02:50] Luciana Alves: Absolutely. And just to confirm, you have the ultimate financial authority to make this purchase, so there wouldn’t be any delays from other departments, correct?\n[2023-10-11T10:02:55] Ahmed Hariri: Yes, I handle these decisions personally.\n[2023-10-11T10:03:08] Luciana Alves: Excellent. Well, Ahmed, based on our discussion today, I think we can set up a demo to give you a better insight into how VerifySim Elite operates in a live environment. Would that be of interest?\n[2023-10-11T10:03:16] Ahmed Hariri: Yes, a demo could be quite clarifying. Let's go ahead and arrange that.\n[2023-10-11T10:03:28] Luciana Alves: Fantastic. I'll have one of our specialists reach out to schedule it at your convenience. We can proceed from there. Is there anything else you need from me today?\n[2023-10-11T10:03:34] Ahmed Hariri: No, that's all for now. You've been very helpful, thanks.\n[2023-10-11T10:03:40] Luciana Alves: My pleasure, Ahmed.

Who do I have the pleasure of talking to?\n[2023-10-13T10:01:10] Aaliyah Jones: Hi Ahmad, this is Aaliyah Jones from VisionTech Solutions. How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-13T10:01:15] Ahmad Zaman: I’m doing well, thank you. How about you?\n[2023-10-13T10:01:20] Aaliyah Jones: I’m great, thanks for asking. I wanted to touch base about your interest in our products. Do you have a good time to discuss this?\n[2023-10-13T10:01:25] Ahmad Zaman: Yes, I have a few minutes. Go ahead.\n[2023-10-13T10:01:30] Aaliyah Jones: Great! I see you're interested in our AIOptics Vision, InnoTrain Hub, and TrainEDU Suite. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're hoping to achieve with these products?\n[2023-10-13T10:01:45] Ahmad Zaman: Sure, we're looking to enhance our training capabilities and improve safety monitoring on our industrial sites. The AIOptics Vision seems perfect for real-time analysis and monitoring, and the TrainEDU Suite should help us standardize our training processes.\n[2023-10-13T10:02:00] Aaliyah Jones: That sounds like a solid plan. The AIOptics Vision is excellent for real-time analysis, offering 24/7 monitoring with high precision. And the TrainEDU Suite provides comprehensive training tools that help in standardizing and tracking employee training. May I ask about the scale of your operations where you'd be using these products?\n[2023-10-13T10:02:10] Ahmad Zaman: We have three main sites and roughly about 300 staff who would benefit from these systems.\n[2023-10-13T10:02:25] Aaliyah Jones: Got it. Approximately four AIOptics Vision units would cover those sites effectively. Also, for the training suite, InnoTrain Hub can aid in centralizing the training modules and tracking the progress.\n[2023-10-13T10:02:40] Ahmad Zaman: That’s what I was thinking too. What about the costs involved? We have a budget ceiling of around $2725.\n[2023-10-13T10:03:05] Aaliyah Jones: Let me break it down for you. Each AIOptics Vision unit is priced at $500, so four units would total $2000. The InnoTrain Hub is $400, and the TrainEDU Suite is $325. That brings your total to $2725, just aligning perfectly with your budget. How does that sound?\n[2023-10-13T10:03:20] Ahmad Zaman: It's reassuring to hear it's within our budget. How soon can we get these installed? Preferably, we'd like it done in less than two days.\n[2023-10-13T10:03:35] Aaliyah Jones: We can definitely meet that timeline. Once we receive the confirmation, our installation team can have everything set up within two days. We prioritize making the transition as seamless as possible.\n[2023-10-13T10:03:45] Ahmad Zaman: Good to know. What about support services post-installation?\n[2023-10-13T10:03:55] Aaliyah Jones: We provide 24/7 customer support and periodic maintenance checks to ensure everything runs smoothly. You’ll have access to an account manager who can address any specific needs.\n[2023-10-13T10:04:10] Ahmad Zaman: That's reassuring. I just need to finalize internally, but I have the authority to move forward with this purchase. Can you send a detailed proposal over email?\n[2023-10-13T10:04:20] Aaliyah Jones: Absolutely! I’ll prepare the proposal and send it your way by the end of the day. Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions in the meantime.\n[2023-10-13T10:04:30] Ahmad Zaman: Thanks, Aaliyah.

11,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

This is Luis Rodriguez from CloudLink Solutions. May I speak with Yuki Tanaka, please?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:08] Yuki Tanaka: Hi Luis! This is Yuki speaking. How can I assist you today?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:20] Luis Rodriguez: Great to speak with you, Yuki. I’m reaching out to discuss your interest in our products—CloudLink Designer, DesignWave Automation, and Workflow Genius. Would now be a good time to chat?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:30] Yuki Tanaka: Sure, I have some time. I'm curious to learn more about how these can benefit my projects.\n[2023-10-21T10:00:45] Luis Rodriguez: Excellent. Let's start with CloudLink Designer. It's designed to optimize your design processes by enabling seamless collaborations and efficient editing. From what I understand, your team often works on tight schedules. Is that correct?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:55] Yuki Tanaka: Yes, exactly. We often have quick turnarounds, and managing that efficiently is crucial.\n[2023-10-21T10:01:10] Luis Rodriguez: Then CloudLink Designer could really be a game-changer for you. It streamlines your workflow and enhances collaboration, so your team can consistently meet deadlines without any hiccups. Can I ask how soon you're looking to implement a solution like this?\n[2023-10-21T10:01:20] Yuki Tanaka: We’re aiming to have everything set up within a couple of days if possible.\n[2023-10-21T10:01:35] Luis Rodriguez: Got it. We can certainly accommodate that timeline. Now, regarding DesignWave Automation, it will automate many of your repetitive tasks, freeing up your team to focus on more strategic initiatives. As someone with financial authority, I'm sure you're interested in the ROI. Each unit of DesignWave Automation can significantly reduce your labor costs associated with manual processes. Does that sound like what you need?\n[2023-10-21T10:01:50] Yuki Tanaka: Absolutely. Reducing repetitive tasks means we can allocate resources more efficiently.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:05] Luis Rodriguez: Exactly. And finally, the Workflow Genius will integrate all tools into a single, intuitive dashboard, providing full oversight into your project pipelines. This can be immensely helpful for maintaining a high-level overview while being able to dive into the specifics as needed.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:18] Yuki Tanaka: That sounds very useful. Can we discuss the pricing? My budget is capped at $2395.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:35] Luis Rodriguez: Certainly. The CloudLink Designer is priced at $895. Each unit of DesignWave Automation is $750, and the Workflow Genius comes to $400 per unit. Let me quickly do the math for you. That brings your total to $2445. With a bit of wiggle room, we might be able to discuss a package deal to fit your budget. Would a minor adjustment like that work for you?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:55] Yuki Tanaka: That sounds potentially workable. I appreciate your flexibility. What would the package deal involve specifically?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:10] Luis Rodriguez: We can offer a slight discount on the Workflow Genius, bringing the total under your budget. This ensures you get all the needed tools without exceeding your cap.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:25] Yuki Tanaka: Perfect. I’d like to move forward with it while staying within the two-day installation timeline.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:40] Luis Rodriguez: Consider it done. I'll prepare the necessary documentation and our installation team will be ready to deploy the solutions promptly. Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:50] Yuki Tanaka: No, I think we’ve covered everything. Thank you for providing such a thorough explanation, Luis.\n[2023-10-21T10:04:00] Luis Rodriguez: It’s my pleasure, Yuki. Thank you for considering us for your project needs. Looking forward to the collaboration!\n[2023-10-21T10:04:05] Yuki Tanaka: Likewise, have a great day!\n[2023-10-21T10:04:10] Luis Rodriguez: You too, Yuki.

14,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:05] Aiko Sugiyama: Hi Mohammed, I’m doing well, thank you! How about yourself?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:12] Mohammed El-Sayed: I’m great, thank you for asking. I'm glad we could connect today. I wanted to talk a bit about your interest in our products — SimuCheck Ultra, CircuitAI Innovator, and NextGen IDE. Is now a good time?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:24] Aiko Sugiyama: Yes, it is a good time. I’ve read a bit about them and I’m excited to see if they might be a fit for our needs.\n[2023-10-20T10:00:36] Mohammed El-Sayed: Perfect! From what I understand, you’re looking at four SimuCheck Ultra units, three CircuitAI Innovators, and four NextGen IDEs. Does that sound correct?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:44] Aiko Sugiyama: Yes, that’s right. We’re looking to enhance our current setup and these seem like they could really improve our workflow.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:00] Mohammed El-Sayed: Great to hear that. Let me give you a quick overview. The SimuCheck Ultra is known for its real-time simulation capabilities, which can significantly speed up your testing phase. Its intuitive interface means less training time and more productivity right out of the box.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:12] Aiko Sugiyama: That sounds promising. What about the CircuitAI Innovator?\n[2023-10-20T10:01:28] Mohammed El-Sayed: The CircuitAI Innovator uses advanced AI algorithms to predict and solve potential circuit design issues before they arise, which saves a considerable amount of revision time. It's been really popular with clients looking to refine their design processes.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:40] Aiko Sugiyama: It sounds like both could really save us time. And how does the NextGen IDE fit in?\n[2023-10-20T10:01:54] Mohammed El-Sayed: The NextGen IDE offers a streamlined development environment that supports multiple languages ideal for any team looking to integrate diverse workflows into one cohesive system. It’s particularly loved for its debugging tools and fast deployment capabilities.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:10] Aiko Sugiyama: That's really useful information. I do have a concern about the budget – we have about 5594 dollars allocated for this project. How does that align with the pricing?\n[2023-10-20T10:02:28] Mohammed El-Sayed: I understand, and working within your budget is definitely a priority for us. Based on the units you're looking at, we have some flexible packages that might just align with your budget. Let me send you a detailed quote after our call, and we can go from there.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:36] Aiko Sugiyama: That would be perfect. I’ll review it as soon as I receive it.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:48] Mohammed El-Sayed: Great. I also wanted to touch on your timeline – you mentioned wanting to finish installation within four days. We can definitely arrange expedited service to meet that requirement.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:56] Aiko Sugiyama: Yes, we’d need that quick turnaround. Are there any additional costs for faster installation?\n[2023-10-20T10:03:10] Mohammed El-Sayed: Typically, there might be a slight surcharge for expedited service, but let’s see what we can do to accommodate this within your budget. I’ll include those details in the quote, and we can discuss adjustments if needed.\n[2023-10-20T10:03:26] Aiko Sugiyama: Sounds good. Let me consult with the team as well since I don't have the ultimate financial authority to make the purchase. Once I have the quote, I can present it to my manager.\n[2023-10-20T10:03:42] Mohammed El-Sayed: Of course, Aiko. Communication is key, and I’m here to help answer any questions your team might have. I’ll get that quote over to you shortly. Is there anything else you wanted to cover today?\n[2023-10-20T10:03:52] Aiko Sugiyama: No, I believe that’s all for now. Thank you so much for your time and the information, Mohammed.\n[2023-10-20T10:04:02] Mohammed El-Sayed: You’re very welcome, Aiko.

How are you today?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:12] Liam Chen: I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:16] Lucas Moreira: I'm great, thank you! I wanted to follow up on your recent inquiry about our products. Is now a good time to discuss?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:20] Liam Chen: Yes, absolutely. I have some time now.\n[2023-10-25T10:00:24] Lucas Moreira: Perfect. So, I see you're interested in the CryptGuard Module, AutoLayout Master, and InnoTrain Hub. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:35] Liam Chen: Sure. We're looking to enhance our security infrastructure and streamline our processes. We need to ensure everything is operational by tomorrow, if possible.\n[2023-10-25T10:00:45] Lucas Moreira: I understand. Time is certainly of the essence. The CryptGuard Module should offer significant security enhancements. It provides robust encryption capabilities that could bolster your data protection measures.\n[2023-10-25T10:00:55] Liam Chen: That sounds promising. Security is definitely a priority.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:02] Lucas Moreira: Absolutely. As for the AutoLayout Master, it's designed to optimize workflow layouts, which should help with any efficiency goals you have. It can handle quite a bit of data with ease.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:08] Liam Chen: Great, we're always looking for ways to improve our efficiency.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:16] Lucas Moreira: And regarding the InnoTrain Hub, it facilitates seamless training and onboarding of new features for your team, which should help keep everyone on the same page with minimal downtime.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:24] Liam Chen: That's actually one of the reasons we looked into it. Training can be such a time drain otherwise.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:34] Lucas Moreira: Exactly. Now, in terms of budget, I see you're working with a budget of $3769. Our pricing does align with that figure, and I can also setup a bundle offer that could provide some savings.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:42] Liam Chen: A bundle offer could be very helpful. Can you send me more details on that?\n[2023-10-25T10:01:52] Lucas Moreira: Certainly, I'll send over all the specifics right after the call, including any discounts available. Now, since you have the ultimate financial authority, what would you need from us to make the decision to move forward?\n[2023-10-25T10:02:02] Liam Chen: Mostly just assurances on installation timings. We really need these systems in place by tomorrow.\n[2023-10-25T10:02:10] Lucas Moreira: We can definitely accommodate that. I can arrange an expedited installation to meet your timeline. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask?\n[2023-10-25T10:02:19] Liam Chen: No, I think you've covered all the key points. I'm feeling confident about proceeding.\n[2023-10-25T10:02:27] Lucas Moreira: Great to hear that, Liam! I'll send over all the information, and we can finalize everything. Expect my email shortly. Thank you for your time today.\n[2023-10-25T10:02:33] Liam Chen: Thank you, Lucas. Looking forward to the details. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-25T10:02:36] Lucas Moreira: You too, Liam.

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

        - Lead Id to be considered is: 00QWt000008981lMAA","From the latest discussions, is this lead eligible for qualification? If they are not, should 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', or 'Timeline' be the disqualifying factors? Return only one or several of the four BANT factors that the lead qualification fails to meet (i.e. 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', 'Timeline').",<execute> SELECT Body__c FROM VoiceCallTranscript__c WHERE LeadId__c = '00QWt000008981lMAA' ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 1 </execute>,"Salesforce instance output: [{'Body__c': ""[2023-10-03T10:00:00] Noura Haddad: Good morning, is this Yuki Tanaka I'm speaking with?\n[2023-10-03T10:00:08] Yuki Tanaka: Yes, this is Yuki. And you must be Noura. How are you today?\n[2023-10-03T10:00:15] Noura Haddad: Yes, this is Noura Haddad. I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How about yourself?\n[2023-10-03T10:00:22] Yuki Tanaka: Doing good, thanks. So, let's dive into it. I understand we're discussing some products from your line?\n[2023-10-03T10:00:30] Noura Haddad: Absolutely. I see you're interested in our DevVision IDE and SimuCheck Ultra. Is that correct?\n[2023-10-03T10:00:38] Yuki Tanaka: Yes, that's right. I'm looking at 4 licenses for DevVision IDE and 1 for SimuCheck Ultra.\n[2023-10-03T10:00:50] Noura Haddad: Great choices. DevVision IDE is known for its robust features tailored for developers, and SimuCheck Ultra provides top-notch simulation and testing capabilities. May I ask what your primary use cases are for these?\n[2023-10-03T10:01:05] Yuki Tanaka: We're ramping up our development team and need a reliable IDE. The SimuCheck Ultra will be used for system simulation to streamline our testing process.\n[2023-10-03T10:01:20] Noura Haddad: That makes perfect sense. Our DevVision IDE will certainly boost your team's productivity with its seamless integration and debugging tools. And SimuCheck Ultra is excellent for cutting down the time spent on testing with its real-time simulation features.\n[2023-10-03T10:01:32] Yuki Tanaka: Those sound promising. Can you tell me more about the pricing and if we can meet our budget which is around $1461?\n[2023-10-03T10:01:50] Noura Haddad: Certainly. For the four licenses of DevVision IDE, you're looking at around $960, and the single SimuCheck Ultra is approximately $500. So, combined, it comes to $1,460, which fits nicely within your budget.\n[2023-10-03T10:02:10] Yuki Tanaka: That's good to hear. We definitely need to stick to that budget. And how soon could we get these installed? We’re hoping to have everything set within 3 days.\n[2023-10-03T10:02:25] Noura Haddad: We can certainly accommodate that timeline. Once we've finalized the order today, our team can handle the installation process right away. Typically, it’s a straightforward process and can be completed promptly.\n[2023-10-03T10:02:38] Yuki Tanaka: Great. Just to clarify, the installation support—does that include any training or manuals?\n[2023-10-03T10:02:50] Noura Haddad: Absolutely, we provide detailed manuals and our support team can offer a brief online training session if needed. Anything to ensure your team gets up to speed quickly.\n[2023-10-03T10:03:02] Yuki Tanaka: That's reassuring. I believe that covers all I needed to know from a product standpoint. Anything else on your end?\n[2023-10-03T10:03:15] Noura Haddad: Just a quick note that this package and support will ensure you get the optimal use of our solutions right from the start. We also offer follow-up services to cater to any evolving needs.\n[2023-10-03T10:03:23] Yuki Tanaka: Perfect. I think we are ready to proceed with placing the order.\n[2023-10-03T10:03:32] Noura Haddad: Fantastic. I'll send over the paperwork along with a summary of what we've discussed. It’s been a pleasure working with you, Yuki.\n[2023-10-03T10:03:39] Yuki Tanaka: Likewise, Noura. Looking forward to a smooth installation process.\n[2023-10-03T10:03:45] Noura Haddad: We'll make sure of that. Have a great day, Yuki.\n[2023-10-03T10:03:49] Yuki Tanaka: You too.

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.

Could you tell me a little more about what you're looking for?\n[2023-10-01T10:00:30] Fatima Al-Mansouri: Yes, I've been considering some security solutions, and the CryptGuard Module caught my eye, though I'm not sure how it might fit into what we're currently doing.\n[2023-10-01T10:00:40] Nadia Al-Balushi: I understand. The CryptGuard Module is designed to enhance your overall data security with robust encryption features. What kind of security measures do you currently have in place?\n[2023-10-01T10:00:50] Fatima Al-Mansouri: We're using some basic firewalls and antivirus software, but nothing too advanced in terms of encryption.\n[2023-10-01T10:01:00] Nadia Al-Balushi: Got it.

It's specifically crafted to seamlessly integrate with existing systems and enhance data protection without causing any disruptions.\n[2023-10-01T10:01:10] Fatima Al-Mansouri: That sounds interesting.

Our team works efficiently to ensure minimal downtime so your operations are uninterrupted.\n[2023-10-01T10:01:50] Fatima Al-Mansouri: Excellent.

Besides the superior encryption, the CryptGuard provides real-time data analytics and threat detection. It helps in identifying potential issues before they become problematic.\n[2023-10-01T10:02:10] Fatima Al-Mansouri: That sounds really useful. We haven't had specific issues, but it's always a concern.\n[2023-10-01T10:02:20] Nadia Al-Balushi: I completely understand. Proactive security measures are always better than reactive ones.

I appreciate you taking the time to call.\n[2023-10-05T10:00:30] Ming Zhao: Absolutely, I understand how busy things can get. I wanted to have a quick chat about your interest in our products, specifically the CollabCircuit Hub and SecureData Nexus. Could we go over your requirements quickly?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:45] Liam O'Connor: Sure, sounds good. I'm looking at getting two CollabCircuit Hubs and four SecureData Nexus units, if you think they're the right fit.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:00] Ming Zhao: Great choices! The CollabCircuit Hub is excellent for team collaboration, offering features like real-time data sharing and integrated communication tools. But just to confirm, you mentioned you'd like the installation completed within three days, correct?\n[2023-10-05T10:01:15] Liam O'Connor: Yes, the timeline is quite tight. We're gearing up for a big project and need everything set up by then.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:30] Ming Zhao: Understood. We specialize in efficient setup and can certainly accommodate that timeline. Just to confirm your budget, you mentioned it was around $2982 for this project?\n[2023-10-05T10:01:40] Liam O'Connor: Correct. We definitely want to stay within budget, if possible.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:50] Ming Zhao: Okay! Fortunately, both the CollabCircuit Hub and the SecureData Nexus are designed to be cost-effective. The combined pricing fits nicely within your budget while covering installation as well.\n[2023-10-05T10:02:00] Liam O'Connor: That sounds promising. What about support post-installation?\n[2023-10-05T10:02:12] Ming Zhao: We offer 24/7 support and comprehensive warranties on all products. Plus, our customer service team is there to help with any issues that might arise.\n[2023-10-05T10:02:22] Liam O'Connor: Great to hear. I just want to ensure we have a reliable backup in case something goes wrong.\n[2023-10-05T10:02:30] Ming Zhao: Absolutely, Liam. Your peace of mind is important to us. Do you have any questions about how these products will integrate with your existing systems?\n[2023-10-05T10:02:40] Liam O'Connor: I'm a bit curious about that. We have an older system in place, so integration is key.\n[2023-10-05T10:02:52] Ming Zhao: I completely understand.

23,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

26,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

It comes with real-time monitoring and automated threat alerts, which would be perfect for enhancing your IT infrastructure. How do you think that aligns with your needs?\n[2023-10-12T10:03:27] Fernando Silva: That sounds promising. Security is a big concern for us, so having something automated is ideal.\n[2023-10-12T10:03:48] Yasmin Farouk: Great to hear that. Now, in terms of pricing, SecuManage Pro is $800 per unit, so for three units, it would be $2,400. Moving on to OptiPower Max, this product is all about optimizing power usage and increasing efficiency, priced at $1,200. It's not large but packs in a lot of functionality.\n[2023-10-12T10:03:55] Fernando Silva: We’re definitely looking to streamline power usage, so OptiPower Max seems like a good fit.\n[2023-10-12T10:04:13] Yasmin Farouk: Excellent choice. Finally, VerifySim Elite helps in accurate simulation and verification workflows. It's priced at $210 per unit, fitting well within your budget for three units at $630. The grand total, including everything, comes to $4,230.\n[2023-10-12T10:04:19] Fernando Silva: Looks good to me. Considering the pricing, the selection is right on point.\n[2023-10-12T10:04:30] Yasmin Farouk: That’s wonderful to hear. We can proceed with the installation plan. Given your timeline, we can have the installation team onsite within two days. Does that schedule work for you?\n[2023-10-12T10:04:36] Fernando Silva: Perfect. Two days from today sounds ideal.\n[2023-10-12T10:04:47] Yasmin Farouk: I'll arrange everything to ensure a smooth setup. I’ll send over the agreement shortly for your review. Since you have the financial authority, once approved, we can get everything moving swiftly.\n[2023-10-12T10:04:53] Fernando Silva: That works, Yasmin. I appreciate the assistance today. Looking forward to working with your team.\n[2023-10-12T10:05:04] Yasmin Farouk: Thank you, Fernando. It's been a pleasure, and we’re excited to partner with you. If you need any further assistance, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-12T10:05:10] Fernando Silva: Thank you, Yasmin. Take care."", 'LeadId__c': '00QWt00000897M0MAI'}]",Timeline

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I wanted to discuss your interest in some of our products. I see you've been looking into our CyberShield Core, NextGen IDE, and AutoLayout Master. Is that right?\n[2023-10-15T10:00:31] Rajesh Kumar: Yes, that's correct. I'm doing some preliminary research. Could you tell me a bit more about these?\n[2023-10-15T10:00:47] Giuseppe Romano: Absolutely. Let's start with CyberShield Core. It's designed to provide comprehensive cybersecurity coverage, protecting your infrastructure against a wide range of threats. You'll find it essential if security is a priority for you.\n[2023-10-15T10:00:55] Rajesh Kumar: It sounds robust, but at the moment, I don't see a pressing need for it in our current setup.\n[2023-10-15T10:01:08] Giuseppe Romano: I understand. On the development side, the NextGen IDE could really enhance your team’s productivity with its intuitive design and advanced debugging tools. This makes coding much faster and more efficient.\n[2023-10-15T10:01:20] Rajesh Kumar: That could be helpful, especially as we're looking to streamline our development processes. And the AutoLayout Master?\n[2023-10-15T10:01:32] Giuseppe Romano: AutoLayout Master simplifies the design phase, allowing you to auto-generate layouts that fit a variety of formats quickly. It's great for reducing time spent on multi-platform design adaptations.\n[2023-10-15T10:01:42] Rajesh Kumar: Sounds useful. But what about the pricing? Does it fit within a budget of $3965?\n[2023-10-15T10:01:53] Giuseppe Romano: Rajesh, with your budget of $3965, we're quite flexible and can discuss bundling options to ensure you get the most value while staying within your financial limits.\n[2023-10-15T10:02:05] Rajesh Kumar: That's promising. Another concern I have is the installation timeline. We really want this finished within 4 days.\n[2023-10-15T10:02:18] Giuseppe Romano: Definitely, we can work with that timeline. Our team is efficient at setting up installations quickly while ensuring everything runs smoothly. We’ll coordinate closely with you to make it work within your schedule.\n[2023-10-15T10:02:28] Rajesh Kumar: Alright, I'm feeling more confident now. What would be the next steps?\n[2023-10-15T10:02:39] Giuseppe Romano: The next step would be to set up a detailed meeting where we can delve deeper into your needs and finalize a custom solution.

I see that you're interested in acquiring 4 units of our AI DesignShift. Could I ask what specifically caught your eye about this product?\n[2023-10-18T10:00:38] Sara Wong: Well, I’m really impressed by its design capabilities, especially how it adapts to our operational needs seamlessly.\n[2023-10-18T10:00:45] Priya Choudhury: Absolutely, the AI DesignShift is fantastic for that. It's designed to enhance creativity with its advanced algorithms, which save time and boost productivity.\n[2023-10-18T10:00:54] Sara Wong: Exactly, that’s why it seems like a good fit.

29,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I see you're interested in the EduTech Advance, CryptSecure Core, and the CryptGuard Module. Let's start with the EduTech Advance, which you’re considering purchasing four units of.

34,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I'm trying to gather some information to see if it's the right fit for us.\n[2023-11-02T10:02:28] Liam O'Sullivan: Perfect. So, I understand you're interested in one unit of the SecuManage Pro. Could you tell me a bit about what you're looking to achieve with this product?\n[2023-11-02T10:02:38] Chloe Dupuis: Well, honestly, I'm not entirely sure.

35,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

36,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

38,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.

I hope you are, too.\n[2023-10-19T10:00:20] Yasmin Farouk: I am, thanks for asking. I understand you’re interested in our NextGen IDE product. Do you mind if we discuss your needs and how we can help you?\n[2023-10-19T10:00:30] Ravi Prasad: Sure, that sounds good. I’m interested in purchasing a couple of licenses.\n[2023-10-19T10:00:40] Yasmin Farouk: Perfect. I see you're interested in two units of the NextGen IDE. Could you tell me a little about what you're looking to achieve with these tools?\n[2023-10-19T10:00:55] Ravi Prasad: We need a robust IDE for our development team that can support multiple languages and provide a seamless experience. We've heard good things about NextGen.\n[2023-10-19T10:01:15] Yasmin Farouk: That's great to hear, and NextGen IDE is indeed designed to offer a versatile and user-friendly environment. It supports over 50 programming languages and includes features like intelligent code completion, integrated debugging, and collaboration tools. How does that sound for your team?\n[2023-10-19T10:01:30] Ravi Prasad: That sounds impressive. We definitely need something that promotes productivity and collaboration among the team.\n[2023-10-19T10:01:50] Yasmin Farouk: Absolutely.

Our team can assist with a streamlined set-up process to meet that timeline. Does that fit your expectations?\n[2023-10-19T10:02:05] Ravi Prasad: Yes, that's perfect.

41,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.

If you're working on innovative hardware projects, it could be a great asset.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:28] Carlos Hernandez: Interesting. We don't do a lot of hardware, but it's something we're exploring.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:34] Anwar Malik: QuantumPCB Modeler would then complement that nicely by offering advanced modeling for PCB designs.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:42] Carlos Hernandez: I see. Honestly, we haven't fully scoped out hardware solutions yet.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:55] Anwar Malik: No worries. As for the installation timeline, I noted you're aiming for completion within three days.

How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:15] Mahmoud Elbaz: I'm doing well, thank you. How about yourself?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:20] Amir Haddad: I'm great, thanks for asking. I'm calling to discuss your interest in our EcoPCB Creator. I believe you’re looking at purchasing four units, correct?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:30] Mahmoud Elbaz: That’s right. I’m looking to get them installed as soon as possible. Ideally, within a day.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:40] Amir Haddad: Absolutely, we can definitely work with that timeline. The EcoPCB Creator is quite efficient. It's designed to streamline your PCB production with eco-friendly materials, which I think aligns well with your company's green initiatives.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:50] Mahmoud Elbaz: That's one of the reasons we're interested. Plus, we have an immediate project that needs them.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:00] Amir Haddad: Great to hear. And with the EcoPCB Creator, you’ll also benefit from reduced waste and lower operational costs in the long run. Given your budget of 1404, four units will come in just slightly above that, but there may be room for some flexibility.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:15] Mahmoud Elbaz: Can you elaborate on the flexibility? I have authority on the budget and can make the purchase decision, but I need to justify it.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:30] Amir Haddad: Certainly. We sometimes offer discounts for bulk purchases or for clients signing up for a maintenance contract. I’d be happy to look into any applicable promotions for you.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:40] Mahmoud Elbaz: That sounds good. A lower total would definitely help my cause.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:50] Amir Haddad: I understand. Let me check our current offers and see how we can work this out for you. Besides the pricing, do you have any questions or concerns about the installation process or the product features?\n[2023-10-17T10:02:00] Mahmoud Elbaz: The installation is what I'm most concerned about since we have a tight deadline. Can you assure this fits into our timeline?\n[2023-10-17T10:02:10] Amir Haddad: Absolutely, we pride ourselves on a quick setup. Our technicians can coordinate directly with your team to ensure everything is up and running within your timeframe.\n[2023-10-17T10:02:20] Mahmoud Elbaz: That's reassuring. We can’t afford delays.\n[2023-10-17T10:02:30] Amir Haddad: I completely understand. With our team on it, you’ll be in good hands.

Before we wrap up, let me confirm the specifics of your purchase and any offers. Should I email the details to you once I have them?\n[2023-10-17T10:03:10] Mahmoud Elbaz: Yes, that'd be very helpful.

44,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

It's perfect for businesses looking to bolster their defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Does that sound like what you’re looking for?\n[2023-10-02T10:01:15] Sara Al-Mansoori: Yes, absolutely. Cybersecurity is a big concern for us right now.\n[2023-10-02T10:01:34] Linh Tran: Great to hear. Now, moving on to the OptiPower Manager, which you are interested in four units. This product is designed to optimize your energy consumption and enhance the efficiency of your power management systems. Given the number of units you're interested in, I assume you are planning a large scale-up?\n[2023-10-02T10:01:54] Sara Al-Mansoori: Exactly. We're expanding our operations, and energy efficiency is a top priority.\n[2023-10-02T10:02:05] Linh Tran: Perfect, the OptiPower Manager will suit your needs precisely. Now regarding your timeline, I remember you mentioned needing the installation to be completed within 2 days. Is that still correct?\n[2023-10-02T10:02:20] Sara Al-Mansoori: Yes, we’d like to have everything set up as quickly as possible once we make a decision.\n[2023-10-02T10:02:35] Linh Tran: Understood. We pride ourselves on our efficient installation process, which can easily meet that timeline. Our team is dedicated to ensuring minimal disruption to your operations.\n[2023-10-02T10:02:48] Sara Al-Mansoori: That sounds good. Could we discuss the pricing? I want to make sure it aligns with our budget.\n[2023-10-02T10:03:10] Linh Tran: Of course. For the CryptSecure Core, the pricing is $1200. As for the OptiPower Manager, each unit is priced at $420, bringing your total to $2880. This fits well within the budget you mentioned earlier.\n[2023-10-02T10:03:30] Sara Al-Mansoori: That's great to hear. And I assume there are no hidden costs involved?\n[2023-10-02T10:03:42] Linh Tran: No hidden costs! What you see is what you pay, and that will cover all aspects, including installation and post-installation support.\n[2023-10-02T10:03:57] Sara Al-Mansoori: That's reassuring. I'm feeling more comfortable with the decision now. If we decide to proceed, what would be the next steps?\n[2023-10-02T10:04:10] Linh Tran: Once you decide to move forward, we'll send you a formal proposal and contract for review. After signing, we can schedule the installation on dates that suit your timeline.\n[2023-10-02T10:04:27] Sara Al-Mansoori: Sounds good. I’ll review everything with my team, but it looks promising. Thank you for all the details, Linh.\n[2023-10-02T10:04:42] Linh Tran: You're welcome, Sara. I'm here to assist with any more questions or clarifications you might need. Feel free to reach out at any time.\n[2023-10-02T10:04:52] Sara Al-Mansoori: Absolutely, I'll do that. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-02T10:05:00] Linh Tran: You too, Sara.

45,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I'm calling to discuss your interest in our products and help determine your needs so we can provide the best solution for you. Do you have a few minutes to chat?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:22] Sophia Rodriguez: Yes, absolutely. I was actually hoping to understand a bit more about what you offer.\n[2023-10-05T10:00:28] Thato Mokoena: Fantastic. I see you're interested in our PCB EcoModel, PulseSim Pro, and SecuManage Pro. Could you tell me a bit about your specific requirements for these products?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:40] Sophia Rodriguez: Sure. We're looking at the EcoModel and SecuManage for our new project installations. We need to ensure the installations are completed within three days. Time is of the essence for us.\n[2023-10-05T10:00:50] Thato Mokoena: Absolutely, installing the PCB EcoModel is quick and efficient. It’s designed with an eco-friendly build that ensures minimal downtime and energy consumption, which should align well with your timeline.\n[2023-10-05T10:00:58] Sophia Rodriguez: That sounds promising. How about the PulseSim Pro? That’s more of a specialized purchase.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:10] Thato Mokoena: The PulseSim Pro is designed for high precision and reliability in simulation environments. It's intuitive to use, so your team can get started quickly without extensive training.

We're trying to streamline as much as possible.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:28] Thato Mokoena: Exactly, and that’s one of the strong points of our solution—everything works synchronously to enhance performance.

I don’t have the final say on budget approvals, though. I'll need to present this to the board.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:48] Thato Mokoena: That's understandable, Sophia. We can also prepare a detailed proposal highlighting all the benefits and justifications, which could aid you when discussing with the board.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:58] Sophia Rodriguez: That would be extremely helpful.

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I wanted to discuss your interest in our EduTech Lab product. Is now still a good time to chat?\n[2023-10-24T10:00:18] Carlos Gonzales: Yes, this is a perfect time. I’m really interested in learning more about the EduTech Lab.\n[2023-10-24T10:00:25] Fatou Ndiaye: Wonderful! Let's dive right in. Just to confirm, you're looking at one unit of the EduTech Lab, correct?\n[2023-10-24T10:00:30] Carlos Gonzales: That's right. We’re looking to enhance our teaching tools, and I believe this could be the right solution.\n[2023-10-24T10:00:44] Fatou Ndiaye: Absolutely, EduTech Lab could be a great fit. It's designed to transform classroom environments with its interactive and responsive technology. May I ask, are you looking to integrate this within a specific curriculum, or is it more a general enhancement?\n[2023-10-24T10:00:52] Carlos Gonzales: It's more of a general enhancement. We want to make our lessons more engaging for the students across different subjects.\n[2023-10-24T10:01:10] Fatou Ndiaye: That makes sense. The EduTech Lab is versatile enough to be used across subjects like science, math, and even language arts. Plus, it comes with a suite of interactive modules that can be customized based on your needs. Are there any specific features you’re particularly interested in?\n[2023-10-24T10:01:22] Carlos Gonzales: We’re interested in the interactive whiteboard feature and the virtual laboratory simulations.\n[2023-10-24T10:01:40] Fatou Ndiaye: Both excellent features! The interactive whiteboard is a favorite among educators for its ease of use and the virtual lab simulations provide a dynamic learning experience without the logistics of setting up a physical lab. These are particularly useful for engaging students and bringing abstract concepts to life.\n[2023-10-24T10:01:55] Carlos Gonzales: That sounds perfect for what we need. Could you tell me about the pricing?\n[2023-10-24T10:02:09] Fatou Ndiaye: Of course! The pricing for one EduTech Lab unit is within your budget range of $466. This includes the hardware, software licenses for a year, and initial on-site training for your staff.\n[2023-10-24T10:02:25] Carlos Gonzales: That's good to know. I should mention, I don't have the ultimate financial authority, but I can influence the decision. Would it be possible to get a more detailed proposal to share with my team?\n[2023-10-24T10:02:40] Fatou Ndiaye: Absolutely, Carlos. I can put together a comprehensive proposal that outlines all the features and benefits, along with the installation process and training details. When would you like to have this by?\n[2023-10-24T10:02:55] Carlos Gonzales: If possible, could you send it by the end of this week? Also, speaking of installation, we’re looking to install within one day. Is that feasible?\n[2023-10-24T10:03:10] Fatou Ndiaye: Certainly, the end of the week works. And as for the installation, we have a team ready to ensure it's completed within a day, so you can start using it right away. Our technicians are very efficient, and they'll make sure it’s a smooth process.\n[2023-10-24T10:03:20] Carlos Gonzales: Great to hear! I’m looking forward to reviewing the proposal with my team.\n[2023-10-24T10:03:29] Fatou Ndiaye: Wonderful, Carlos. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other questions you have at this stage?\n[2023-10-24T10:03:34] Carlos Gonzales: Not at the moment, Fatou. I appreciate all the information you’ve provided.\n[2023-10-24T10:03:44] Fatou Ndiaye: My pleasure! I’ll send that proposal over by the end of the week, and feel free to reach out if anything else comes up. Thank you for your time today, Carlos.\n[2023-10-24T10:03:51] Carlos Gonzales: Thank you, Fatou. I’ll look forward to receiving the proposal. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-24T10:03:55] Fatou Ndiaye: You too, Carlos! Goodbye.""}]",Authority

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I wanted to discuss your interest in our products, CloudLink Designer and UnitySim Essentials. Do you have a few minutes to chat?\n[2023-10-10T10:00:25] Marcus Svensson: Sure, I have some time now.\n[2023-10-10T10:00:30] Elena Petrova: Fantastic. I noticed you’re interested in purchasing four of each product. Could you tell me a bit more about what you’re hoping to achieve with these tools?\n[2023-10-10T10:00:45] Marcus Svensson: Well, we’re exploring some new projects that might benefit from enhanced design and simulation capabilities. Still, I’m not exactly clear how these would fit in just yet.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:05] Elena Petrova: That's understandable. To give you a clearer picture, CloudLink Designer is excellent for collaborative design projects, allowing teams to work seamlessly together. UnitySim Essentials can simulate various environments, which can be incredibly beneficial for project testing and refinement. Does that align with any of your current objectives?\n[2023-10-10T10:01:20] Marcus Svensson: It sounds promising. But given our timeline for implementation, which is within three days, how feasible would that be?\n[2023-10-10T10:01:35] Elena Petrova: We usually aim for quick turnarounds, but three days is quite tight. However, we have expedited service options that could meet your deadline. Would that be something you’d consider?\n[2023-10-10T10:01:45] Marcus Svensson: Possibly, although I should mention that I don't have the final say on financial commitments for these purchases.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:55] Elena Petrova: I see. While we discuss options, would it be useful for you to have a detailed proposal to present to your decision-makers?\n[2023-10-10T10:02:00] Marcus Svensson: Yes, that would definitely help.\n[2023-10-10T10:02:10] Elena Petrova: Great. In terms of pricing, both products are competitively priced but buying in multiples often allows us to offer some discounts. Your budget is $4,337, correct?\n[2023-10-10T10:02:15] Marcus Svensson: Yes, that's correct.\n[2023-10-10T10:02:30] Elena Petrova: We’ll do our best to tailor the proposal to fit your budget while maximizing value. We could also arrange a demo to help clarify how these tools can benefit your projects. How does that sound?\n[2023-10-10T10:02:40] Marcus Svensson: A demo would be very helpful, especially to convince the finance team.\n[2023-10-10T10:02:50] Elena Petrova: Perfect. I’ll schedule a demo and have the proposal, including any potential discounts, sent over to you by tomorrow.

I'll forward you my contact details after the call.\n[2023-10-10T10:03:05] Elena Petrova: Excellent. Thanks so much for your time, Marcus. I'll be in touch soon with the next steps.

This is Anwar Malik from Tech Innovations. How are you today?\n[2023-11-01T10:00:08] Satoshi Tanaka: Hi Anwar, I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\n[2023-11-01T10:00:15] Anwar Malik: I'm great, thanks for asking. I wanted to take a moment to discuss your interest in our DesignWave Automation product. Do you have a few minutes?\n[2023-11-01T10:00:25] Satoshi Tanaka: Sure, I have some time now. I’ve heard positive things about it and wanted to see if it fits my needs.\n[2023-11-01T10:00:35] Anwar Malik: Wonderful. You've indicated an interest in purchasing two units. Can you share a bit more about what you're looking to achieve with DesignWave Automation?\n[2023-11-01T10:00:51] Satoshi Tanaka: Certainly. We need to improve our production line efficiency, and from what I've read, DesignWave seems like it could streamline a lot of our processes.\n[2023-11-01T10:01:05] Anwar Malik: Absolutely, Satoshi. DesignWave can automate repetitive tasks and optimize workflows, leading to faster production times. Will you be the one making the purchase decision, or is there a team involved?\n[2023-11-01T10:01:15] Satoshi Tanaka: It's up to me to make the final decision on this purchase, which simplifies things.\n[2023-11-01T10:01:30] Anwar Malik: That does make things easier. Our current budget options show that DesignWave Automation units are priced at $802 each. Your interest in two units falls just within your budget range of $804. How does that sound?\n[2023-11-01T10:01:48] Satoshi Tanaka: That works financially. I'm also on a pretty tight installation schedule. Ideally, we’d like everything set up and operational within a day. Is that possible?\n[2023-11-01T10:02:05] Anwar Malik: Yes, our team is quite experienced in quick installations, and for DesignWave, a one-day setup is definitely achievable. Just to confirm, that will cover installation and initial system tests.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:15] Satoshi Tanaka: Great to hear that. And what about after-sales support?\n[2023-11-01T10:02:27] Anwar Malik: We offer a comprehensive support package that includes 24/7 customer service, troubleshooting assistance, and free software updates for the first year.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:36] Satoshi Tanaka: That sounds excellent. It gives me peace of mind knowing support is available if needed.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:47] Anwar Malik: Exactly, our goal is to make your transition as smooth as possible. Is there anything else you'd like to know or discuss about the DesignWave products?\n[2023-11-01T10:02:55] Satoshi Tanaka: Nothing comes to mind right now. I think you’ve covered most of it.\n[2023-11-01T10:03:08] Anwar Malik: Alright, then, to sum up: you'll be purchasing two DesignWave Automation units, we'll proceed with the one-day installation, and you’ll have our support package. Does that sound good to proceed with?\n[2023-11-01T10:03:14] Satoshi Tanaka: Yes, it does. Let’s go ahead with it.\n[2023-11-01T10:03:25] Anwar Malik: Excellent. I'll send over the paperwork today and arrange for a team to begin installation tomorrow. Thank you, Satoshi. We're excited to work with you.\n[2023-11-01T10:03:33] Satoshi Tanaka: Thanks, Anwar. I look forward to seeing the improvements in our production line.\n[2023-11-01T10:03:38] Anwar Malik: You're welcome.

50,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

And you?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:28] Hana Kato: I'm great, thanks for asking. The reason I'm calling today is to discuss your interest in some of our products—specifically, DesignEdge Pro, CloudInnovate Space, and AIOptics Vision. Do you have a few moments to chat?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:35] Jean Dupont: Yes, I do. I've been looking into these products and considering them for our upcoming projects.\n[2023-10-20T10:00:45] Hana Kato: Great! Let's dive right in. I see you're interested in two units of DesignEdge Pro, one CloudInnovate Space, and four AIOptics Vision. What makes you interested in these particular products?\n[2023-10-20T10:01:00] Jean Dupont: Well, our team really needs advanced design software like the DesignEdge Pro, and the cloud solution seems to fit perfectly for our remote operations. As for AIOptics Vision, AI integration is crucial for us.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:20] Hana Kato: Absolutely, makes sense. DesignEdge Pro is known for its comprehensive design capabilities and user-friendly interface. Plus, combining it with CloudInnovate Space gives you seamless access and collaboration for your teams. Also, AIOptics Vision is cutting-edge in providing real-time analytics with AI precision.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:35] Jean Dupont: Sounds good! I'm particularly concerned about the installation timing. We need everything up and running within four days.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:48] Hana Kato: We can definitely accommodate that. Our professional installation team is highly efficient, and for the products you're interested in, we ensure the setup is completed within your required timeframe.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:00] Jean Dupont: That's reassuring. Another concern is the pricing. Our budget is around 4160.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:15] Hana Kato: I understand budget is crucial. For the combination of these products, we have flexible financing options, and we can work on a package that fits within your 4160 budget or discuss payment plans that could ease the process.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:25] Jean Dupont: That would be helpful. I'll need to discuss this internally since I don't have ultimate financial authority.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:35] Hana Kato: Absolutely, Jean, and I’m here to provide any additional information or proposal details you might need for those discussions.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:40] Jean Dupont: Perfect. Could you send over the details via email?\n[2023-10-20T10:02:50] Hana Kato: Of course. I’ll send a detailed proposal and include the pricing, features, and installation timelines later today.

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.

This is John Williams from Tech Solutions. How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:12] Rachel Cohen: Hi John, I’m doing well, thank you. Just wrapping up a few things on my end. How about you?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:24] John Williams: I’m great, thanks for asking! I’ve been looking forward to our conversation today regarding your interest in our CollabCircuit Hub.\n[2023-10-20T10:00:35] Rachel Cohen: Absolutely. We’ve been considering it as it seems to meet our needs perfectly.\n[2023-10-20T10:00:42] John Williams: That’s fantastic to hear! To get started, could you tell me a bit more about what specific needs you’re looking to address with the Hub?\n[2023-10-20T10:00:52] Rachel Cohen: Sure, we’re looking to streamline our internal communications and collaboration. Especially since our teams are increasingly remote, having an integrated platform would be a game changer.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:10] John Williams: The CollabCircuit Hub is designed exactly for that. It offers seamless integration with various tools and supports real-time collaboration. Having remote teams is challenging, but with the Hub, everyone stays connected and productive.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:28] Rachel Cohen: That sounds promising. Could you tell me more about how quickly we could get this up and running? We're aiming to have something in place very soon, ideally within a day.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:40] John Williams: Certainly! Once everything is in place, our installation team can have it up and running within a day. They are quite efficient and will ensure it’s operational without any hiccups.\n[2023-10-20T10:01:52] Rachel Cohen: Perfect, that's exactly what we need. What about the pricing? We're working with a budget of around $1667.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:08] John Williams: Right, so with your interest in 4 units of the CollabCircuit Hub, the pricing is quite competitive. Given your budget, we can offer you a tailored quote that aligns with what you're looking to spend.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:20] Rachel Cohen: I appreciate that. And in terms of features, does the Hub support integration with other software we already use?\n[2023-10-20T10:02:35] John Williams: Absolutely, it integrates with over 100 different platforms. Whether it’s project management tools, calendars, or communication apps, the Hub can link them all up seamlessly.\n[2023-10-20T10:02:50] Rachel Cohen: Great news. We’d be needing that for sure. Honestly, I like what I’m hearing. What are the next steps for us here, then?\n[2023-10-20T10:03:02] John Williams: Great to hear, Rachel! The next step would be for us to finalize a proposal and send it over to you today. Once you’re good with it, we can schedule the delivery and installation.\n[2023-10-20T10:03:14] Rachel Cohen: Sounds like a plan. I look forward to receiving the proposal and moving forward. Thanks for your help, John!\n[2023-10-20T10:03:27] John Williams: Thank you, Rachel. I’ll have the proposal sent over shortly. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out anytime.

53,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

May I speak with Aisha Patel, please?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:05] Aisha Patel: Hi Mei, this is Aisha speaking.\n[2023-10-21T10:00:10] Mei Lin: Hi Aisha! Thanks for taking my call today. How's your day going so far?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:18] Aisha Patel: No problem, Mei. My day's going well, just busy as always. How about you?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:24] Mei Lin: I'm doing well, thanks for asking! I wanted to chat with you about the products you've shown interest in—VerifySim Elite, FlexiDesign Pro, and SecuManage Pro. Do you have a few minutes to discuss these?\n[2023-10-21T10:00:35] Aisha Patel: Sure, that sounds good. I'm curious to know more about them.\n[2023-10-21T10:00:45] Mei Lin: Great! Let’s start with VerifySim Elite. It's a simulation software that’s perfect for creating detailed virtual environments. Many of our clients use it for training and testing purposes. Does this sound like something that could benefit your operations?\n[2023-10-21T10:01:00] Aisha Patel: It sounds interesting, but honestly, I’m not sure if we have a specific need for it at the moment. We were just exploring options.\n[2023-10-21T10:01:15] Mei Lin: Understood. It's important to find the right fit. VerifySim Elite could be a tool to enhance your team’s efficiency, but let’s move on to FlexiDesign Pro. You mentioned you were interested in four licenses. Is there a particular project you’re considering it for?\n[2023-10-21T10:01:30] Aisha Patel: We're considering it for an upcoming project that involves a lot of design work. We're looking to streamline our process.\n[2023-10-21T10:01:45] Mei Lin: FlexiDesign Pro is ideal for that. It offers a rich set of features for visual and spatial design, collaboration tools, and much more. Plus, it can integrate smoothly with most of your existing tools, which should help in speeding up your projects.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:00] Aisha Patel: That’s good to know. And what about SecuManage Pro? We’re looking into security management solutions as well.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:15] Mei Lin: SecuManage Pro is great for comprehensive security management. It provides real-time monitoring and threat detection across multiple devices, which helps in maintaining the integrity of your data and systems. Would enhanced security be a priority for your team?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:28] Aisha Patel: Yes, security is always a top priority for us. It sounds like what we need.\n[2023-10-21T10:02:38] Mei Lin: That's excellent. Based on your interest, if you were to proceed with one VerifySim Elite license, four FlexiDesign Pro licenses, and two SecuManage Pro licenses, your approximate investment would be $3,660. Does this align with your budget?\n[2023-10-21T10:02:50] Aisha Patel: Yes, that's within our budget. How soon could we get everything installed?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:00] Mei Lin: We can definitely work with that budget. As for the installation timeline, we can coordinate to complete everything within four days after the purchase is confirmed. Does that timeline suit you?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:15] Aisha Patel: That works for us. I just need to review some more details before moving forward. Can you send me an email with all the information we discussed today?\n[2023-10-21T10:03:25] Mei Lin: Absolutely, Aisha. I’ll send over a detailed email with all the product specs, pricing, and the installation process right after our call. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:35] Aisha Patel: Thank you, Mei. I’ll keep an eye on my inbox. I appreciate your time today.\n[2023-10-21T10:03:42] Mei Lin: My pleasure, Aisha. Thank you for considering our solutions. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-21T10:03:45] Aisha Patel: You too, Mei.

56,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

How are you today?\n[2023-10-12T10:00:15] Kai Takahashi: I'm doing well, Felix. Thanks for asking. How about you?\n[2023-10-12T10:00:22] Felix Jørgensen: I'm great, thank you! The weather's finally cooling down here, so that's nice. Anyway, I understand you’re interested in some of our products, and I wanted to discuss your needs to see how we can best support you.\n[2023-10-12T10:00:35] Kai Takahashi: Yes, that's right. I’ve been looking at the CloudInnovate Space, AutoLayout Master, and CryptGuard Module. I believe they could be very beneficial for our operations.\n[2023-10-12T10:00:45] Felix Jørgensen: Fantastic choices! Just to confirm, you're interested in one CloudInnovate Space, and three each of the AutoLayout Master and CryptGuard Module, correct?\n[2023-10-12T10:00:51] Kai Takahashi: Yes, that's the plan.\n[2023-10-12T10:00:57] Felix Jørgensen: Great, Kai. Can I ask, what specific needs do you have that you believe these products can fulfill?\n[2023-10-12T10:01:10] Kai Takahashi: Well, we're looking to upgrade our security and enhance our project management capabilities. The CryptGuard Module seems to have excellent security features, and the AutoLayout Master appears to be very user-friendly for design tasks.\n[2023-10-12T10:01:26] Felix Jørgensen: Absolutely, you've hit the nail on the head. The CryptGuard Module offers top-tier encryption and security protocols, perfect for protecting sensitive data. The AutoLayout Master is also designed to streamline design processes, saving both time and resources.\n[2023-10-12T10:01:41] Kai Takahashi: That sounds ideal. I do have a timeline concern though. We’re looking to have everything up and running within four days. Is that feasible?\n[2023-10-12T10:01:52] Felix Jørgensen: Certainly, we can accommodate that timeline. We have an efficient team that handles installations speedily and professionally. We can prioritize your installation to meet your deadline.\n[2023-10-12T10:02:05] Kai Takahashi: Great to hear. And about the cost, could you provide some clarity on that aspect? I have a budget of 3875.\n[2023-10-12T10:02:22] Felix Jørgensen: Sure. Let me break it down for you. The CloudInnovate Space is 1500, each AutoLayout Master is 600, and each CryptGuard Module is 450.

This is Sophia Müller from Tech Innovate Solutions. How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:10] Li Wei: Good morning, Sophia. I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:15] Sophia Müller: I'm great, thank you for asking. I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss your interest in our products, PCBProto Wizard and SimuFlow Xtreme. Is now a good time?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:20] Li Wei: Yes, absolutely. I’m looking forward to learning more.\n[2023-10-25T10:00:30] Sophia Müller: Fantastic! I see you're interested in three units of PCBProto Wizard and two units of SimuFlow Xtreme. Could you tell me a bit more about your specific needs?\n[2023-10-25T10:00:45] Li Wei: Sure. We have a new project coming up where rapid prototyping and simulation are crucial. We’ve heard good things about your products regarding efficiency and performance.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:05] Sophia Müller: I'm glad to hear that. Both products are designed to enhance workflow efficiency. The PCBProto Wizard is perfect for quick prototyping with its fast setup and user-friendly interface. SimuFlow Xtreme, on the other hand, excels in delivering high-precision simulation results, which sounds like it would be a great fit for your project.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:25] Li Wei: That sounds promising. Another concern for us is the installation. We’re hoping to get everything up and running within 3 days. Is that feasible?\n[2023-10-25T10:01:40] Sophia Müller: Absolutely, we understand the importance of a quick turnaround. Our team can coordinate installation to meet that timeline. We also provide comprehensive support to ensure everything goes smoothly.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:55] Li Wei: Great to hear. Budget is also a consideration for us. We’ve allocated around $2494 for this purchase. How do the pricing and payment work for these products?\n[2023-10-25T10:02:20] Sophia Müller: The total for the selected products would be slightly above your budget at list price. However, depending on our current promotions and considering the volume, we might be able to find a solution that fits. I'd recommend discussing it further with our finance team.\n[2023-10-25T10:02:35] Li Wei: That makes sense. I’ll have to speak with my manager as I don’t have ultimate financial authority, but understanding the ballpark and any potential for negotiations helps.\n[2023-10-25T10:02:50] Sophia Müller: Absolutely, Li. We strive to be flexible and work within our clients' constraints. Would it help if I sent over some detailed quotes and potential financing options for you to present?\n[2023-10-25T10:03:00] Li Wei: Yes, that would be very helpful. I can review those with my manager and get back to you.\n[2023-10-25T10:03:10] Sophia Müller: Great. I’ll email you those details today. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?\n[2023-10-25T10:03:20] Li Wei: Not at the moment. I just need to go over everything with my team. I appreciate your help, Sophia.\n[2023-10-25T10:03:30] Sophia Müller: My pleasure, Li. Feel free to reach out anytime if more questions come up. I'll follow up later in the week, if that works for you.\n[2023-10-25T10:03:35] Li Wei: Sounds good. Thank you again, and have a great day!\n[2023-10-25T10:03:40] Sophia Müller: You too, Li.

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

This is Nguyen Thi Minh from TechInnovate Solutions. How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:10] Kim Seung-woo: Hi, Minh. I’m doing well, thank you. How about yourself?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:20] Nguyen Thi Minh: I’m great, thanks for asking. I wanted to take a moment to discuss some of the products you showed interest in. Particularly, the DevVision IDE, CollabCircuit Hub, and CloudLink Designer. Do you have a few minutes to talk?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:35] Kim Seung-woo: Yes, sure. I’ve been looking into them but wanted more information to decide.\n[2023-10-16T10:00:50] Nguyen Thi Minh: Great. Let me give you a quick overview. Starting with DevVision IDE, it’s our integrated development environment that enhances coding efficiency and collaboration. It also offers powerful debugging tools. Is that something that would benefit your team?\n[2023-10-16T10:01:10] Kim Seung-woo: Well, our team has been using a different IDE, so I’m unsure. I’d really need to see how it enhances efficiency.\n[2023-10-16T10:01:30] Nguyen Thi Minh: Absolutely, I understand. We offer trial versions where you can evaluate the features before making any commitments. This way, you can see how it performs hands-on. Would you be interested in that?\n[2023-10-16T10:01:45] Kim Seung-woo: That sounds reasonable. I would like to test it out.\n[2023-10-16T10:02:00] Nguyen Thi Minh: Perfect. As for the CollabCircuit Hub, it’s excellent for enhancing team connectivity, especially if you have remote workers. It improves project management and facilitates communication. Do you currently face challenges in these areas?\n[2023-10-16T10:02:15] Kim Seung-woo: We do have some communication issues, especially with remote staff. That’s why I’m looking into this product.\n[2023-10-16T10:02:30] Nguyen Thi Minh: CollabCircuit Hub can definitely help with that. It integrates seamlessly with existing tools and improves workflow communication significantly.\n[2023-10-16T10:02:45] Kim Seung-woo: Great to know. What about the pricing? I have a budget of around $2979, and I need to ensure everything fits into this.\n[2023-10-16T10:03:05] Nguyen Thi Minh: Absolutely, Mr. Kim. Let me break it down for you. The CollabCircuit Hub for four units falls well within your budget constraints. We might need to discuss the DevVision IDE and CloudLink Designer depending on specific configurations you desire. Do the features or package options interest you more that I could tailor around your budget?\n[2023-10-16T10:03:24] Kim Seung-woo: I think I’m most interested in CollabCircuit Hub due to our communication needs, and maybe we can scale later for DevVision and CloudLink.\n[2023-10-16T10:03:45] Nguyen Thi Minh: That’s perfectly fine. Just a quick note on the CloudLink Designer—it's a versatile tool for managing cloud-based projects, should you need enhanced cloud operations. But scaling sounds like a smart starting point.\n[2023-10-16T10:04:05] Kim Seung-woo: I’ll keep that in mind. Alright. How soon can we proceed with the installation? I need it set up within three days.\n[2023-10-16T10:04:20] Nguyen Thi Minh: We can definitely accommodate that timeline. Once everything is aligned and approved on your end, our team can start the installation within those three days. We pride ourselves on a smooth process.\n[2023-10-16T10:04:38] Kim Seung-woo: Okay, that reinforces my confidence. I’ll need one more meeting to get everything approved internally, but I am the final decision maker here.\n[2023-10-16T10:04:52] Nguyen Thi Minh: I appreciate you letting me know, Mr. Kim. We’ll be ready when you are. Feel free to reach out with any other questions. Would it help if I emailed you a detailed proposal to review with your team?\n[2023-10-16T10:05:05] Kim Seung-woo: Yes, that would be very helpful. Send it over to my email, and I’ll take it from there.\n[2023-10-16T10:05:15] Nguyen Thi Minh: Will do. Expect it in your inbox shortly. Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to hearing back soon.\n[2023-10-16T10:05:22] Kim Seung-woo: Thank you, Minh. Speak to you soon.\n[2023-10-16T10:05:27] Nguyen Thi Minh: Goodbye, Mr. Kim."", 'CreatedDate': '2023-10-16T10:00:01.000+0000'}]",Need
62,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

How about you?\n[2023-10-10T10:00:16] Alberto Gomez: I'm good, thanks. Just busy with the usual things.\n[2023-10-10T10:00:22] Maria Papadopoulos: I understand, I'll try to keep this brief. I see you're interested in our AutoLayout Master product, is that right?\n[2023-10-10T10:00:26] Alberto Gomez: That's correct. I'm looking at getting two units.\n[2023-10-10T10:00:35] Maria Papadopoulos: Great! The AutoLayout Master is really popular because of its intuitive design and ability to streamline layout projects. Can I ask what specific needs you're looking to address with it?\n[2023-10-10T10:00:51] Alberto Gomez: We have several ongoing projects, and efficiency is key. We need something that can help us cut down on the layout time while maintaining precision.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:04] Maria Papadopoulos: That makes sense. The AutoLayout Master is perfect for that. It's equipped with advanced algorithms that can reduce layout time by up to 30%. Plus, it's super easy to integrate into your current systems.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:13] Alberto Gomez: That sounds promising. What's the cost for two units?\n[2023-10-10T10:01:22] Maria Papadopoulos: Each unit is priced at $522, so for two units, it would be $1,044. Would this fit within your budget?\n[2023-10-10T10:01:30] Alberto Gomez: Yes, that's right at our limit, but it works.\n[2023-10-10T10:01:35] Maria Papadopoulos: Fantastic.

Just a quick note, is there anyone else involved in the approval process for this purchase?\n[2023-10-10T10:02:02] Alberto Gomez: I'll need to run it by our finance manager. I handle the technical needs, but she signs off on purchases.\n[2023-10-10T10:02:11] Maria Papadopoulos: Got it. I'd be happy to provide any additional information she might need to make the decision easier. Also, would you like me to send over a detailed proposal for her review?\n[2023-10-10T10:02:19] Alberto Gomez: Yes, that would be great. Please include all the details so she can go through it thoroughly.\n[2023-10-10T10:02:26] Maria Papadopoulos: Absolutely, I'll send over a detailed proposal right after our call, including installation timelines and support options.\n[2023-10-10T10:02:35] Alberto Gomez: Perfect.

I'm just exploring ways to enhance what we have.\n[2023-11-01T10:01:15] Monique Dubois: That makes sense.

Efficiency is always something we can work on.\n[2023-11-01T10:01:30] Monique Dubois: And as for Workflow Genius, it's designed to enhance team collaboration by automating routine tasks, giving your team more time to focus on strategic initiatives.\n[2023-11-01T10:01:40] Carlos Gutierrez: That sounds interesting. I guess I'm concerned about the cost and how quickly we can have everything up and running.\n[2023-11-01T10:01:52] Monique Dubois: Completely understand your concerns, Carlos. Now, based on your interest and the pricing, I see your budget is around $2638. Both these products are well within that range, especially given the volume discount if purchased together.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:00] Carlos Gutierrez: That's good to hear. And about the installation timeline?\n[2023-11-01T10:02:15] Monique Dubois: Yes, we've developed comprehensive support teams to ensure installations are smooth. Typically, we can have everything operational within 4 days from purchase. We prioritize minimal disruption to your current operations.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:25] Carlos Gutierrez: That speed is reassuring. I have the final say in our purchases, so that's no issue, but making sure it's worth our while is key.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:35] Monique Dubois: Absolutely, Carlos. Perhaps a demo could help? That way, you could experience firsthand how these tools can benefit your team without any commitment.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:41] Carlos Gutierrez: That might be the best next step. A demo sounds useful.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:47] Monique Dubois: Perfect. I’ll arrange a demo session suited to your schedule. What time works best for you?\n[2023-11-01T10:02:54] Carlos Gutierrez: Next week, around Tuesday or Wednesday works for me. Maybe late morning?\n[2023-11-01T10:03:03] Monique Dubois: Great!

65,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I can imagine. Let's make this as efficient as possible for you. I understand you're interested in our VerifySim Elite, AI Cirku-Tech, and SimulateX Edge solutions?\n[2023-10-05T10:01:28] Carlos Ramirez: Yes, that's correct. I'm looking into getting 2 units of the VerifySim Elite, 4 of the AI Cirku-Tech, and 2 of the SimulateX Edge.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:45] Linh Tran: Excellent choice!

66,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I've been looking into these products, and they seem like they could be a good fit for our needs.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:40] Sophia Müller: Great to hear! To better understand how we can assist you, could you tell me a bit more about your specific needs?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:55] Tariq Al-Mohammed: Sure, we’re looking for something that offers reliable performance with energy efficiency, especially as we transition to more sustainable operations.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:10] Sophia Müller: The EcoPower Convert is excellent for optimizing energy consumption while maintaining high performance levels.

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

How about you?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:20] Aarav Sharma: I'm great, thanks for asking. I wanted to follow up with you today regarding your interest in our EcoPCB Creator. Is now a good time to chat?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:25] Alice Smith: Yes, I have a few minutes. I'm very interested in learning more about it.\n[2023-10-05T10:00:30] Aarav Sharma: Fantastic! Just to confirm, you're looking to purchase one unit, correct?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:35] Alice Smith: That's correct. One unit to start with.\n[2023-10-05T10:00:40] Aarav Sharma: Great. So, EcoPCB Creator is designed to streamline the PCB prototyping process, making it not only more efficient but also environmentally friendly by reducing material waste. Does that align with what you're looking for?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:50] Alice Smith: Yes, definitely. We're keen on sustainable options and this seems to be a good fit. Could you tell me more about the solution's capabilities?\n[2023-10-05T10:01:05] Aarav Sharma: Certainly! The EcoPCB Creator boasts high-precision machining, and it's compatible with most CAD software, allowing for seamless design integration. You can also expect a quick turnaround time for prototypes, which is perfect if you're looking to hit tight project deadlines.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:15] Alice Smith: That sounds promising.

I remember our initial discussion putting it slightly over my current budget. Is there any flexibility on the price?\n[2023-10-05T10:01:55] Aarav Sharma: I understand budget constraints. The retail price is $400, but given your interest and urgency, I can offer a discount to match your budget of $351 as a special consideration.\n[2023-10-05T10:02:10] Alice Smith: Wow, that is helpful, thank you, Aarav. I do need to run this past my supervisor since I don't have full financial authority.

I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. I understand you're interested in some of our products, and I wanted to discuss them with you to see how they might fit your needs.\n[2023-11-01T10:02:50] Fatou Bamba: Sure, I looked at a few options online. I'm curious about VeriSim Express, SecureData Nexus, and AutoGen IDE.\n[2023-11-01T10:03:05] Adebola Adeyemi: Great choices! These products offer a range of capabilities. Could you share a bit about what you're hoping to achieve with these solutions?\n[2023-11-01T10:03:20] Fatou Bamba: Honestly, I'm not completely sure how they'll fit in yet. I just heard good things and thought I should explore them.\n[2023-11-01T10:03:35] Adebola Adeyemi: That's perfectly fine. Let me give you a brief overview of each product. VeriSim Express is excellent for simulation-based testing, which enhances efficiency and accuracy in complicated scenarios.\n[2023-11-01T10:03:50] Adebola Adeyemi: SecureData Nexus, on the other hand, is geared towards data protection, ensuring your critical information is secure and easily manageable across different platforms.\n[2023-11-01T10:04:05] Adebola Adeyemi: And then there's AutoGen IDE, a fantastic tool for streamlining the development process with automation, significantly cutting down your project timelines.\n[2023-11-01T10:04:20] Fatou Bamba: I see. And how do the pricing and installation work?\n[2023-11-01T10:04:35] Adebola Adeyemi: For pricing, the VeriSim Express is priced at $900, SecureData Nexus at $600 each, and AutoGen IDE at $450 each.

72,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

73,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

This is Aarav Bansal from Tech Solutions. How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-11T10:00:10] Ravi Sharma: Hi Aarav, I’m doing well, thanks! How about you?\n[2023-10-11T10:00:18] Aarav Bansal: I’m great, thank you for asking. I’m calling to discuss your interest in our CollabDesign Studio product and help understand your needs better.\n[2023-10-11T10:00:30] Ravi Sharma: Yes, I'm interested in learning more about it. We’re looking to improve our collaborative design processes.\n[2023-10-11T10:00:45] Aarav Bansal: Great! You've chosen the right solution for enhancing collaboration efforts. CollabDesign Studio is designed to integrate design tools with team communication. Can you tell me a bit about your current setup?\n[2023-10-11T10:01:05] Ravi Sharma: Currently, our team uses a mix of standalone design applications, but the collaboration part isn’t seamless. We’re looking for something that can unify these processes.\n[2023-10-11T10:01:20] Aarav Bansal: Absolutely, I understand the frustration. CollabDesign Studio offers real-time co-editing features and integrates with existing design apps to streamline team collaboration. It should be a good fit for your needs.\n[2023-10-11T10:01:35] Ravi Sharma: That sounds promising. Could you tell me more about the installation process? We’re actually on a tight schedule and need this up ideally within a day.\n[2023-10-11T10:01:50] Aarav Bansal: Certainly, installation is straightforward and typically takes just a few hours. Our support team would ensure you're up and running within the time frame you require.\n[2023-10-11T10:02:05] Ravi Sharma: Good to know. I’ve also got a budget to keep in mind. We're aiming at around $875 for this setup.\n[2023-10-11T10:02:20] Aarav Bansal: I completely understand. Let me check our pricing. For two units of CollabDesign Studio, I might be able to work out a package that aligns with your budget. Pricing typically includes support and updates.\n[2023-10-11T10:02:32] Ravi Sharma: That would be helpful. Can this purchase be approved directly with you?\n[2023-10-11T10:02:45] Aarav Bansal: I can certainly facilitate the process. However, if additional financial approval is needed from your side, we can work together to ensure everything is aligned.\n[2023-10-11T10:03:00] Ravi Sharma: Yes, I'll need to run it by my manager, but I do want to move forward if we hit the budget.\n[2023-10-11T10:03:15] Aarav Bansal: That sounds great, Ravi. Let’s ensure we provide all the necessary information to ease the approval process. Would it be possible to schedule a call with you and your manager to go over the final details?\n[2023-10-11T10:03:28] Ravi Sharma: That’s a good idea. I can arrange something later this week. How about Thursday?\n[2023-10-11T10:03:40] Aarav Bansal: Thursday works for me. I’ll send over a calendar invite and some documentation on CollabDesign Studio for your review.\n[2023-10-11T10:03:50] Ravi Sharma: Perfect, looking forward to it. Thanks for the information today, Aarav.\n[2023-10-11T10:03:58] Aarav Bansal: You're welcome, Ravi. I appreciate your time and interest in our solution.

How's your day going so far?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:15] Dmitry Popov: Not too bad, thanks for asking. And yourself?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:20] Pierre Fontaine: I'm doing well, thank you! I'm reaching out today because I see you've shown interest in some of our products—specifically, the CloudInnovate Space, AutoLayout Master, and CryptGuard Module. I wanted to have a quick chat to understand your needs a bit better and see how we can help. Is this still a good time for you?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:30] Dmitry Popov: Sure, I've got a few minutes.\n[2023-10-05T10:00:35] Pierre Fontaine: Great! Let's dive right in. Could you tell me a bit about what you're looking to achieve with these products?\n[2023-10-05T10:00:45] Dmitry Popov: Well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. I was curious about what they could offer. It's more of an exploratory interest.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:00] Pierre Fontaine: That's perfectly alright. Let's start with the CloudInnovate Space. This product is designed to streamline your cloud management tasks, offering seamless integration with multiple platforms. It can significantly reduce complexity and save time. Does simplifying cloud operations sound like something that would benefit your team?\n[2023-10-05T10:01:10] Dmitry Popov: Yeah, I can see how that would be useful.\n[2023-10-05T10:01:20] Pierre Fontaine: Excellent.

It’s designed with advanced encryption and threat detection.

75,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

78,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

And for the SimuCheck Ultra, it specializes in real-time simulations to predict system behavior under various conditions. It's quite handy for proactive troubleshooting.\n[2023-10-18T10:01:07] Amara Olufemi: That's useful. We sometimes deal with unexpected system behaviors, and having real-time data would definitely help.\n[2023-10-18T10:01:18] Priyanka Iyer: I think it will be a good match. Now, regarding the InnoTrain Hub, you mentioned needing four units. This platform is exceptional for integrating various training modules, ensuring your team stays aligned with the latest practices.\n[2023-10-18T10:01:26] Amara Olufemi: Yes, training updates are critical for us. Having a scalable solution would be ideal.\n[2023-10-18T10:01:37] Priyanka Iyer: InnoTrain Hub fits that requirement perfectly. It allows for scaling according to your organizational growth. Plus, it can be deployed efficiently, which fits your three-day installation timeline. Does that work for you?\n[2023-10-18T10:01:51] Amara Olufemi: It sounds like it. Timeliness is key. By the way, I've noted that the overall budget is crucial, as there are limitations on my end. Can we discuss the pricing?\n[2023-10-18T10:02:15] Priyanka Iyer: Certainly. The combined package for one AI DesignShift, one SimuCheck Ultra, and four InnoTrain Hubs comes to approximately $2700. I understand your budget is set at $2531. We can explore some options to ensure everything is perfectly aligned, perhaps consider phased integration or bundling certain services. Would that be helpful?\n[2023-10-18T10:02:32] Amara Olufemi: That could work. I don't handle final approvals, but I'll definitely need those options clearly laid out to present to our finance team.\n[2023-10-18T10:02:43] Priyanka Iyer: Absolutely, I'll send you a detailed proposal with various configurations and pricing breakdowns tomorrow. Is there anything specific you'd like me to include?\n[2023-10-18T10:02:55] Amara Olufemi: Please include any potential cost savings or bundled offers. And if possible, a comparison with any competitors' offerings could strengthen our case.\n[2023-10-18T10:03:08] Priyanka Iyer: Of course, I'll make sure we include all those details. Once your team reviews it, we can reconvene to drill down into any particular aspects that need addressing. How does that sound?\n[2023-10-18T10:03:15] Amara Olufemi: Sounds like a plan. I appreciate your help in navigating this, Priyanka.\n[2023-10-18T10:03:25] Priyanka Iyer: My pleasure, Amara! I'll be in touch soon with the proposal. Looking forward to collaborating. Have a great rest of your day!\n[2023-10-18T10:03:30] Amara Olufemi: You too, Priyanka. Thank you!"", 'CreatedDate': '2023-10-18T10:00:00.000+0000'}]",Authority

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

81,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I see you're interested in the EnergyReduce Pro?\n[2023-11-14T10:00:18] James Wong: Yes, that's right. I'm looking at a few options to improve our energy efficiency, and your product seems promising.\n[2023-11-14T10:00:30] Zanele Mofokeng: That's fantastic to hear. The EnergyReduce Pro is one of our most effective solutions for significantly reducing energy consumption. To confirm, you were looking at getting three units, correct?\n[2023-11-14T10:00:36] James Wong: Yes, three should be just right for our needs.\n[2023-11-14T10:00:50] Zanele Mofokeng: Perfect. Just to give you a bit more detail, each EnergyReduce Pro unit can cut energy costs by up to 30%, and they are incredibly easy to install and maintain. We also make sure all installations are completed swiftly. You mentioned you want to get everything set up within a day. We can definitely accommodate that timeline.\n[2023-11-14T10:01:10] James Wong: That’s great to hear. Speed is definitely a factor for us. How about the pricing? My budget is around 1011.\n[2023-11-14T10:01:30] Zanele Mofokeng: Absolutely, let’s look at the numbers. Each EnergyReduce Pro unit is priced at 330, so for three units, it would total 990. This fits well within your budget of 1011. Additionally, we offer a one-year warranty and excellent post-installation support.\n[2023-11-14T10:01:45] James Wong: That sounds reasonable.

I wanted to ask, how customizable is the system?\n[2023-11-14T10:02:20] Zanele Mofokeng: The EnergyReduce Pro is quite versatile and can be customized to suit various energy consumption needs. Our technicians can assess your current setup and make necessary adjustments to optimize performance.\n[2023-11-14T10:02:30] James Wong: Great, that sounds like it’ll work well for us. What are the next steps if I decide to go ahead?\n[2023-11-14T10:02:45] Zanele Mofokeng: Once you confirm, we can draft a tailored proposal for you to review. After that, we’ll proceed with scheduling the installation. Since you’re ready to make a decision, we can fast-track this and have everything in place as early as tomorrow.\n[2023-11-14T10:02:55] James Wong: That sounds ideal, Zanele. Let's proceed with the proposal. I appreciate your thoroughness.\n[2023-11-14T10:03:05] Zanele Mofokeng: My pleasure, James. I’ll send that proposal over shortly.

- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.

This is Dalia Herz from TechSolutions. How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-12T09:45:07] Ethan Choi: Hi Dalia! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?\n[2023-10-12T09:45:15] Dalia Herz: I'm doing great, thank you! So, I'm reaching out because I see you’ve shown some interest in our SecureFlow Suite and CloudInnovate Space products. I’d love to find out more about your needs and see how we can assist you.\n[2023-10-12T09:45:31] Ethan Choi: Yeah, I looked at those. I'm just exploring options right now, trying to see if they might fit in with our current systems.\n[2023-10-12T09:45:40] Dalia Herz: Absolutely, I can help with that. Just to get started, could you tell me what you're currently using for your systems?\n[2023-10-12T09:45:54] Ethan Choi: We're using a basic setup, nothing too complex at the moment. I guess the main thing is seeing if your solutions can integrate smoothly with what we have.\n[2023-10-12T09:46:10] Dalia Herz: Got it. The SecureFlow Suite, for instance, is specifically designed to integrate seamlessly with existing setups, providing enhanced security with minimal disruption. It’s really flexible in that regard.\n[2023-10-12T09:46:21] Ethan Choi: That sounds promising. And the CloudInnovate Space, how does that fit in?\n[2023-10-12T09:46:35] Dalia Herz: CloudInnovate Space focuses more on optimizing data storage and accessibility. It's perfect for businesses looking to streamline their cloud processes and enhances collaboration among remote teams.\n[2023-10-12T09:46:48] Ethan Choi: Okay, I see. Honestly, we haven’t entirely nailed down what we need. We are open to suggestions on how your products could benefit us.\n[2023-10-12T09:47:03] Dalia Herz: No problem at all, Ethan. During this call, we can certainly explore possibilities based on your description. Now, I noticed you’re looking at four units for each product. Is that right?\n[2023-10-12T09:47:14] Ethan Choi: Yes, that's correct. Our initial thoughts aligned with those quantities. I'm hoping they fit within our budget of 4572.\n[2023-10-12T09:47:32] Dalia Herz: Hmm, let’s see what we can do there. Generally, we offer some flexibility on pricing depending on package selections and commitments. With your budget and the financial authority you hold, I can certainly bring this to our team for discussion on possible discounts or tailored packages.\n[2023-10-12T09:47:48] Ethan Choi: That would be appreciated. Another thing is our timeline. Ideally, we want everything installed within three days. Is that feasible?\n[2023-10-12T09:48:03] Dalia Herz: The three-day timeline is ambitious, but given the right coordination, we can facilitate a fast-tracked implementation. Our team is adept at rapid deployments, especially when it’s critical for your operations.\n[2023-10-12T09:48:16] Ethan Choi: That's good to hear. So, what's next in the process?\n[2023-10-12T09:48:29] Dalia Herz: Next, how about we set up a follow-up meeting where we can dive deeper into these products and align them more closely with your business objectives? Shall I send some timeslots over email?\n[2023-10-12T09:48:40] Ethan Choi: Yes, let's do that. I’ll look over the details and discuss it with my team too.\n[2023-10-12T09:48:51] Dalia Herz: Perfect, Ethan. Thanks for the chat today. I’ll send over the meeting details right after our call, along with some additional product information specific to your setup.\n[2023-10-12T09:49:00] Ethan Choi: Sounds good, Dalia. Looking forward to it.\n[2023-10-12T09:49:05] Dalia Herz: Great! Thanks again, Ethan. Have a wonderful day!\n[2023-10-12T09:49:10] Ethan Choi: You too, Dalia.

84,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

        ## Lead qualification guide.
        Look for the voice call transcripts with the lead and relevant knowledge articles to justify the lead qualification.
        
        - Lead Id to be considered is: 00QWt0000089A5CMAU","Should this lead be considered qualified based on their recent discussions? If not, is it due to 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', or 'Timeline'? Return only one or several of the four BANT factors that the lead qualification fails to meet (i.e. 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', 'Timeline').","<execute> SELECT Id, Title, FAQ_Answer__c FROM Knowledge__kav WHERE Title LIKE '%BANT%' OR FAQ_Answer__c LIKE '%BANT%' </execute>",Salesforce instance output: [],Need
87,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

We’re currently using DesignPro Suite.\n[2023-10-28T10:03:02] Junaid Khan: Great question. AI DesignShift is designed to integrate seamlessly with several design tools, including DesignPro Suite. This integration allows for smoother workflow transitions and maximizes design capabilities.\n[2023-10-28T10:03:14] Mehdi Ziad: That sounds promising. Will that require additional setup time?\n[2023-10-28T10:03:27] Junaid Khan: Typically, integrations are part of our standard setup process, so it won't add significant time. We can include it in your one-day timeline.\n[2023-10-28T10:03:38] Mehdi Ziad: Great. I’ll need to discuss this with my team. Could you send me some more detailed information?\n[2023-10-28T10:03:50] Junaid Khan: Of course, I’ll email you a detailed proposal including the cost breakdown and integration specifics. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n[2023-10-28T10:03:59] Mehdi Ziad: No, that covers my questions for now. Thanks, Junaid.\n[2023-10-28T10:04:07] Junaid Khan: Thanks, Mehdi.

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I wanted to follow up on the inquiry you made about some of our products. Do you have a few minutes to chat?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:24] Olga Stepanova: Sure, I have some time now.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:28] Felix Jørgensen: Wonderful. So, I see you're interested in the PulseSim Pro, CryptGuard Module, and AIOptics Vision. Is that right?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:32] Olga Stepanova: Yes, that's correct. I'm curious about these products, but I’m not entirely sure which one would be the best fit for my company.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:36] Felix Jørgensen: I understand. Let's go through each one and address any questions you may have.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:44] Felix Jørgensen: Starting with the PulseSim Pro, it's an advanced simulation tool designed to improve your operational efficiency by 30% over traditional methods. What primarily interests you about this product?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:52] Olga Stepanova: Well, efficiency sounds appealing, but I don’t have a specific need for it yet. Could it assist with data analysis?\n[2023-10-17T10:01:00] Felix Jørgensen: Absolutely, it features an integrated data analysis module that can provide insights in real-time, which might be beneficial if you're looking at optimizing processes.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:06] Olga Stepanova: That sounds interesting.

It's built with next-gen encryption, and since you'd want four units, it can certainly scale across different departments to ensure all data is thoroughly protected.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:24] Olga Stepanova: Security is definitely a priority. And the installation timeline—3 days, is it feasible for these products?\n[2023-10-17T10:01:34] Felix Jørgensen: Yes, our team is quite efficient. We typically aim to meet tight timelines and have technicians available who can handle both the installation and any post-installation support you might need.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:42] Olga Stepanova: That's reassuring. How about the AIOptics Vision then?\n[2023-10-17T10:01:52] Felix Jørgensen: AIOptics Vision enhances workflow by leveraging AI to automate routine tasks and offers predictive analysis for trends in your data landscape.

90,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time, Lina. I really appreciate it.\n[2023-10-19T10:02:54] Lina Rodríguez: Thank you, Jorge.

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?

I'm considering one unit.\n[2023-10-25T10:01:35] Nikolai Volkov: SecureTrack Pro is one of our flagship products in security management. It provides comprehensive surveillance and fully supports AI-driven threat detection, ensuring safety and security aren’t compromised.

This is Miguel Torres from AI Tech Solutions. How are you today?\n[2023-10-21T09:03:20] Christina Müller: Hi Miguel! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\n[2023-10-21T09:03:32] Miguel Torres: I'm doing great, thanks for asking! I wanted to thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I understand you’ve expressed some interest in our products, particularly the CircuitAI Innovator and AI DesignShift.\n[2023-10-21T09:03:45] Christina Müller: Yes, that's right. I’m looking at getting four of the CircuitAI Innovator units and one AI DesignShift.\n[2023-10-21T09:04:10] Miguel Torres: Great choice! Both products are really popular due to their efficiency and advanced technology. Just to confirm, our CircuitAI Innovator models are designed for optimal circuit management, providing real-time analytics to improve operational efficiency. The AI DesignShift, on the other hand, offers intuitive design capabilities for enhanced project planning and execution.\n[2023-10-21T09:04:28] Christina Müller: That sounds promising. I definitely need something that will streamline our processes and improve productivity.\n[2023-10-21T09:04:42] Miguel Torres: Absolutely, our clients have reported significant improvements in those areas. Just to touch on the budget, I see here that we're aiming for around $2,544. Is that correct?\n[2023-10-21T09:04:50] Christina Müller: Yes, that's the budget I’m working with.\n[2023-10-21T09:05:00] Miguel Torres: Perfect.

Our pricing is competitive, and we offer flexible financing options if needed.\n[2023-10-21T09:05:14] Christina Müller: That’s good to know. I would prefer to have everything finalized soon.

We prioritize quick installations and our team is equipped to ensure everything runs smoothly within your timeline.\n[2023-10-21T09:05:38] Christina Müller: Great, that’s a relief. Does your team handle the installation, or do I need to arrange for a third party?\n[2023-10-21T09:05:50] Miguel Torres: Our team takes care of the entire installation process. They’re highly trained professionals who ensure everything is set up accurately and efficiently.\n[2023-10-21T09:06:00] Christina Müller: Good to hear. And just so I'm clear, am I directly handling the purchase, or is there any other formality I should know about?\n[2023-10-21T09:06:12] Miguel Torres: Given that you have ultimate financial authority, you’ll just need to approve the final quote, and we can proceed from there.\n[2023-10-21T09:06:20] Christina Müller: Sounds straightforward.

93,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

All three of these products work seamlessly together to enhance security and improve operational efficiency.\n[2023-10-01T10:01:10] Olga Sokolova: Okay, so can you give me a breakdown of what these products do?\n[2023-10-01T10:01:20] Monique Dubois: Sure thing. The CryptSecure Core is our advanced encryption solution, designed to protect sensitive information with multi-layered security protocols. It's perfect for financial data protection and secure communications.\n[2023-10-01T10:01:30] Olga Sokolova: Hmm, that sounds useful. How about the other two?\n[2023-10-01T10:01:40] Monique Dubois: The SecureFlow Suite is designed for network management and ensures that data flows smoothly and securely across your systems, which reduces downtime and improves productivity.\n[2023-10-01T10:01:50] Monique Dubois: Finally, UnitySim Essentials offers simulation tools that allow you to test and optimize your configurations in a virtual environment before implementation. It’s particularly valuable for avoiding potential issues and costly mistakes.\n[2023-10-01T10:02:00] Olga Sokolova: That sounds promising. My biggest concern is the budget and whether this is really necessary for us right now.\n[2023-10-01T10:02:10] Monique Dubois: Understood, and it’s important that you get the best value. Can I ask what your current challenges are? Sometimes identifying them helps in determining necessity.\n[2023-10-01T10:02:20] Olga Sokolova: Honestly, we're not facing any major issues at the moment, just considering our options for if and when we scale.\n[2023-10-01T10:02:30] Monique Dubois: That makes sense. These solutions are not only beneficial for current operations but also scale efficiently as your business grows. It's about planning for future security and operational reliability.\n[2023-10-01T10:02:40] Olga Sokolova: That sounds logical. What about the pricing? You mentioned they complement each other; is there a package deal or something?\n[2023-10-01T10:02:50] Monique Dubois: Absolutely, when purchased together, we offer a bundled discount. Each product is priced competitively to fit a set budget. Given your intended purchase, you’d be looking at around $5,000 all together including discounts, just about fitting your budget of $5407.\n[2023-10-01T10:03:00] Olga Sokolova: That seems reasonable. Also, important to me is the installation timeline. I really need it done within three days after purchase.\n[2023-10-01T10:03:10] Monique Dubois: Not a problem at all, Olga. We offer express installation services, and we can certainly accommodate an installation within three days. Our team will ensure a smooth and timely transition.\n[2023-10-01T10:03:20] Olga Sokolova: Great, that’s reassuring.\n[2023-10-01T10:03:30] Monique Dubois: Fantastic. Just to confirm, you have the ultimate authority to make the purchase, right?\n[2023-10-01T10:03:40] Olga Sokolova: Yes, that's correct. I'm in charge of financial decisions here.\n[2023-10-01T10:03:50] Monique Dubois: Perfect. With that, I can prepare a proposal for you to review, and we can proceed with the setup whenever you’re ready.\n[2023-10-01T10:04:00] Olga Sokolova: That would be perfect. Send it over, and I’ll take a look.\n[2023-10-01T10:04:10] Monique Dubois: Excellent. I’ll have it sent to your email by this afternoon. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out.\n[2023-10-01T10:04:20] Olga Sokolova: Thanks, Monique. I’ll keep an eye out for the proposal.\n[2023-10-01T10:04:30] Monique Dubois: Thank you, Olga. I appreciate your time today, and I look forward to working together.\n[2023-10-01T10:04:40] Olga Sokolova: Likewise. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-01T10:04:50] Monique Dubois: You too. Bye!""}]",Need

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I think they could really benefit our learning platform and sustainability initiatives.\n[2023-10-12T10:00:42] Junaid Khan: That sounds great! Just to confirm, you are looking at four units of EduFlow Academy and three units of EcoPCB Creator. Does that align with your current needs?\n[2023-10-12T10:00:54] Sophia Zhang: Yes, that's correct.

96,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

Who's this?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:10] Carlos Fernandez: Hi Wei, this is Carlos Fernandez from TechInnovations. How are you doing today?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:15] Wei Chen: Hi Carlos, I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:20] Carlos Fernandez: I’m doing great, thanks for asking! I'm reaching out to discuss your interest in some of our products, particularly the DevVision IDE, AI Cirku-Tech, and the EcoPower Convert. Do you have a few minutes to chat?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:30] Wei Chen: Sure, I’ve been looking into these products and I’m definitely interested in learning more.\n[2023-10-16T10:00:35] Carlos Fernandez: Great to hear! Just to clarify, it looks like you're considering 1 DevVision IDE, 4 AI Cirku-Tech, and 3 EcoPower Convert units, right?\n[2023-10-16T10:00:40] Wei Chen: That's correct.\n[2023-10-16T10:00:50] Carlos Fernandez: Perfect. Let’s start with the DevVision IDE. It’s our state-of-the-art integrated development environment that really enhances productivity with features like real-time collaboration and AI-assisted coding. Do you have any specific needs when it comes to development tools?\n[2023-10-16T10:01:00] Wei Chen: Yes, we need something that can streamline our coding process and facilitate team collaboration effectively.\n[2023-10-16T10:01:10] Carlos Fernandez: DevVision is indeed perfect for that. It includes tools for version control, team chat, and code review integrations—all built-in, making collaboration a breeze. Now, moving on to the AI Cirku-Tech, which you've shown a significant interest in. It's exemplary for automating processes with its deep learning capabilities.\n[2023-10-16T10:01:20] Wei Chen: Right, automation is a big focus for us going forward.\n[2023-10-16T10:01:30] Carlos Fernandez: The AI Cirku-Tech can handle data processing, predictive analytics, and much more, ultimately saving time and improving accuracy in your workflows. Now, regarding the EcoPower Convert, its key strength lies in its highly efficient power conversion, perfect for any setups prioritizing energy efficiency.\n[2023-10-16T10:01:40] Wei Chen: Energy efficiency is definitely an attribute we're looking for. Could you give me some clarity on the installation? We’re targeting a two-day completion.\n[2023-10-16T10:01:50] Carlos Fernandez: Certainly! Our installation team is highly experienced and can efficiently handle both the DevVision IDE setup and the hardware installations for AI Cirku-Tech and EcoPower Convert within your timeline. We'd work with you to ensure minimal disruption to your operations.\n[2023-10-16T10:02:00] Wei Chen: Sounds promising. And in terms of costs, will these fit within our budget of $4,136?\n[2023-10-16T10:02:10] Carlos Fernandez: Good question. For the quantity you require, the pricing is competitive. Let me break it down: The DevVision IDE is priced at $1,000, each AI Cirku-Tech unit is $650, and each EcoPower Convert unit is $400. That would bring your total to $3,800. So, it fits comfortably within your specified budget.\n[2023-10-16T10:02:30] Wei Chen: That's a relief. With the pricing matching our budget, we're in a good spot. Are there any contracts or commitments we should be aware of?\n[2023-10-16T10:02:40] Carlos Fernandez: We do offer flexible packages with options for long-term service agreements that come with benefits like extended warranties and discounted upgrades. However, it's entirely up to you if you'd like to opt-in.\n[2023-10-16T10:03:00] Wei Chen: That sounds reasonable. I might consider it after the installation is complete. For now, I think we've covered the main points.\n[2023-10-16T10:03:10] Carlos Fernandez: Absolutely, Wei. I'll send over a detailed proposal along with the next steps for installation. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out at any time.\n[2023-10-16T10:03:20] Wei Chen: Thanks, Carlos. You've been very helpful. Looking forward to moving ahead.\n[2023-10-16T10:03:30] Carlos Fernandez: My pleasure, Wei! Looking forward to working together. Have a great day!\n[2023-10-16T10:03:35] Wei Chen: You too, Carlos.

99,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

I'm reaching out because I understand you're interested in our CircuitMaster Analyzer and PowerPro Optimize products?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:21] Li Jun: Yes, that's correct. We've been looking into them for our upcoming projects.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:27] Noura Haddad: Fantastic! Could you share a bit more about how you plan to use these products?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:33] Li Jun: Sure, we have a couple of new installations coming up and we want something that can help us streamline the process and optimize efficiency.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:41] Noura Haddad: Absolutely. Our CircuitMaster Analyzer is perfect for detailed circuit diagnostics, and the PowerPro Optimize can help enhance power efficiency, which will be key for your installations.\n[2023-10-17T10:00:49] Li Jun: That sounds promising. What about the installation process for these products?\n[2023-10-17T10:00:57] Noura Haddad: Installation is straightforward.

Our current budget is around $1830. Will this be enough?\n[2023-10-17T10:01:22] Noura Haddad: Let me pull up the latest pricing for you. With your budget, we can certainly work something out for the quantities you need.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:28] Li Jun: Thanks, Noura. I won't have the final say on the purchase, though. I'll need to propose this to our finance team.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:36] Noura Haddad: That's completely fine. We often work with finance teams for budget approvals. I can send you detailed quotes and specifications to aid your proposal.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:41] Li Jun: That would be really helpful. I’ll make sure everything is ready for review.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:46] Noura Haddad: Great. Just to confirm, we're looking at two CircuitMaster Analyzers and one PowerPro Optimize, correct?\n[2023-10-17T10:01:50] Li Jun: Yes, that’s right.\n[2023-10-17T10:01:55] Noura Haddad: Perfect.

2,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

5,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

8,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

11,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?

<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:

14,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

17,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)

20,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

25,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

26,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>

29,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.

34,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

37,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

40,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

43,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

46,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

47,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

49,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

52,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

53,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

55,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action

61,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

64,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:

67,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

68,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

70,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

71,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

73,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

74,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

76,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

77,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

79,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

80,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

82,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

83,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

85,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

88,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

89,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

91,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

92,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

94,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>

99,"You are an expert in Salesforce and you have access to a Salesforce instance. 

# Instructions
- You will be provided a question, the system description, and relevant task context.
- Interact with the Salesforce instance to build Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) or Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) queries as appropriate, to help you answer the question.
- Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) can be used to construct text-based search queries against the search index.
- Your generation should always be an Action command and NOTHING ELSE. Generate only one Action command.
- DO NOT generate ANY system observation, you will receive this based on your Action command.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.
- If the user's request is unclear or under-specified, use the respond action to ask for clarification before proceeding with queries or submitting an answer.

Here is a description of how to use this command:
## Action
- Can be 'execute' or 'submit'.
- execute, to execute SOQL that will return the observation from running the query on the Salesforce instance.
- submit, to return the final answer of the task to the user.
- Format: <execute> a valid SOQL query </execute> or <respond> user response </respond>

# Guidelines
- Execute SOQL/SOSL queries to understand the Salesforce instance that will help you find the answer to the question.
- When you are confident about the answer, submit it.
- Always end with a submit action containing ONLY the answer, NO full sentence or any explanation.
- If no record is found matching the requirements mentioned, just return 'None'.

# Example 1
Question: What is the total number of opportunities?
Output:
<execute> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity </execute>
     (If the observation from the Salesforce instance 100, your next step can be)
<respond> 100 </respond> OR <respond> The total number of opportunities is 100 </respond>

# Example 2
Question: Look for the name Joe Smith in the name field of a lead and return the name and phone number.
Output:
<execute> FIND {Joe Smith} IN NAME FIELDS RETURNING Lead(Name, Phone) </execute>
    (If the observation from the Salesforce instance is [{Joe Smith, 1234567890}], your next step can be)
<respond> Joe Smith, 1234567890 </respond> OR <respond> The name is Joe Smith and the phone number is 1234567890 </respond>
