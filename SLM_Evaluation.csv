 соответствии с требованиями Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) или Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL), выполните следующую шаг:

1. Объяснение оценки требования: ""Budget"", ""Authority"", ""Need"", ""Timeline"" — это 4 фундаментальных параметра, которые должны быть в ответе, если lead не удастся qualify.
2. Составьте соответствующую SOSL query, чтобы получить ответ на вопрос ""Which of the following: 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', 'Timeline', are the reasons?"". 
3. Если не найден ответ, воспользуйтесь следующим шагам:

 уверенно. Lead qualification should focus on 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', or 'Timeline'. If the lead is not qualified, these factors will be the reasons. If the lead is qualified, these reasons will be the ones we are looking for.

Here is a potential SOQL query to identify the BANT factors that the lead qualification fails to meet:

 соответствии требованияам, выполните следующую шаг:

1. Объяснение о том, что такое BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) и как они связаны с выбором BANT factors.
2. Составьте SOQL/SOSL query to identify the relevant BANT factors.
3. Execute the appropriate Action command to generate the observation or respond with the answer.
  
Lead qualification is determined by the BANT factors. Here are the BANT factors that the lead qualification fails to meet:

- Budget
- Authority
- Need
- Timeline

The BANT factors that the lead qualification fails to meet are: ['Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', 'Timeline'].

If the lead","SELECT Body__c, CreatedDate FROM VoiceCallTranscript__c WHERE LeadId__c = '00QWt00000893q9MAA' ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 1",lead_qualification_qwen3_06b
"
 уверенно. Let's start by identifying the BANT factors that the lead qualification fails to meet. These factors are responsible for determining the correct BANTs to use.

Looking at the question, we need to determine if the lead qualification fails to meet any of the four BANT factors: 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', or 'Timeline'. If they do, we need to find the reasons behind these failures.

After a thorough analysis, here are the BANT factors that the lead qualification fails to meet:
- 'Budget'
- 'Authority'
- 'Need'
- 'Timeline'

These factors are responsible for determining the correct BANTs to use. If the lead qualification fails to meet any of these factors, we need","SELECT Id, LeadId__c, Body__c FROM VoiceCallTranscript__c WHERE LeadId__c = '00QWt00000899NgMAI'",lead_qualification_qwen3_06b
"
овать
.Execute
SELECT Id, Title, Summary FROM Knowledge__kav Where Title 'Lead qualification guide' And Id 'e8f8e4e8e' Return Lead LastName And Producer Lead Owner Id

For the relevant BANT factors, the output should be one or several of the following: 'Budget', 'Authority', 'Need', 'Timeline'. If no BANT factor is identified, return 'NoneOfTheseFactorsisRequired' or 'BALANCE'.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for each BANT factor:

1. **Budget**: The lead's qualification is related to their budget. If the lead is outside the budget, we should not qualify them.

" standpoint of this question is to determine whether a lead should be included in any future analysis or reporting task. If so, which BANT factors are relevant? (Do not return any unrelated BANT factors! Instead, focus and utilize the BANT verbs.) 

For each BANT factor, if the relevant BANT factor does NOT exist, do not assign it to this question. If returning an <execute> action, be sure to use the proper Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) syntax for transforming the domain knowledge you've gathered from the Salesforce instance or for guiding your search through the relevant fields.

The question is asking us to determine if the lead is qualified (BANT) and justify their absence. If not, is it due to any of the four BANT factors mentioned earlier.

Consider the following steps to answer this question:
1. Analyze the 'WhatId' and 'OwnerId' from the EmailMessage object to find the relevant Opportunity ID.
2. Use the Opportunity ID to retrieve the 'OpportunityLineItem' and 'OpportunityLineItem_Pricebook2' objects.
3. For each relevant Line Item, retrieve the 'VoiceCallTranscript__c' and","SELECT Id, LeadId__c, Body__c FROM VoiceCallTranscript__c WHERE LeadId__c = '00QWt00000899NgMAI'",lead_qualification_qwen3_06b_v2
